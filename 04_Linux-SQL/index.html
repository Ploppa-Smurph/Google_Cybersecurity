            <i>"I am currently on summer break from an Associates in Applied Sciences degree in Cybersecurity at a local community college. I wanted to take this class to reenforce my knowledge and to fill in any gaps that my other courses may have missed. In the 3 courses I have completed from the Coursera Google course there has been a wealth of information, some things I have yet to cover in the college courses. 
                I am familiar with Linux and have used SQL before, but I look forward to practicing any relevant knowledge that deals with the cybersecurity industry. I have taken coursework on networks before and on working with databases and am always happy to learn more about how these will relate to my chosen career field. 
                I hope to see more real world situational examples so that I can relate my knowledge to actual events that I might come across at work, in the future. I am looking forward to being exposed to more tools and utilities that I will work with in my upcoming career.

        <b>05) Discussion: Your Background in Operating Systems</b>
                <i>'I have grown up around computers and have lots of experience using different Operating Systems. I have both Windows and Linux computers, including RHEL, Rocky, Ubuntu, Manjaro, Kali, and more. The first computer system I had ran Microsoft Dos and was all command line interface. Through the years I realized that I have a lot of experience with different Operating Systems, but no necessarily a lot of knowledge about the more powerful tools and utilities that are available. The main reason I am trying to enter into the Cybersecurity field is because I want a career instead of another job and I want to learn and better utilize the power and potential of my home network. 
                    I use Windows 11 on a day to day basis with my school work and through my home network, I also use Manjaro and Ubuntu fairly regularly because I have a couple of servers set up on those systems. I really want to know more about how to communicate between my Linux and Windows systems. I have been able to SSH between the systems, but I want to see about linking the servers in with my network more easily. I am hoping to continue to learn so that I will be able to ask the right questions and find the correct answers.

    <h2>04.03 Operating Systems at Work</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Inside the Operating System</b>
                  1) boot computer - interact with hardware - starts BIOS / UEFI - which contains the booting instructions from the Bootloader
                  2) bootloader starts the OS 
                 
              Users use Applications to interact with the OS, the OS then interacts with the system Hardware
                the Hardware returns information to the OS and the OS then returns to the Application     
        
        <b>02) Requests to the Operating System</b>
                - First, the user decides they want to download a file that they found online, so they click on a download button near the file in the internet browser application.
                - Then, the internet browser communicates this action to the OS.
                - The OS sends the request to download the file to the appropriate hardware for processing.
                - The hardware begins downloading the file, and the OS sends this information to the internet browser application. The internet browser then informs the user when the file has been downloaded.
    
        <b>03) Practice: Order of Operations in the OS</b>
        
        <b>04) Resource Allocation via the OS</b>
                the OS handles Resource and Memory management 

        <b>05) Virtualization Technology</b>
                VM - Virtual Machine = software representation of physical computer hardware
               
              Security - creates an isolated environment 
                                ** some malicious code can escape and infect a host machine
              Efficiency - can utilize more physical resources by creating additional virtual machines
                             ex: car vs bus -- bus can hold more people and is more efficient
              Managing Virtual Resources - manage through the Hypervisor 
                  we will use KVM (Kernel-Based Virtual Machine), a common Linux hypervisor                      
    </pre>
    <h2>04.04 User Interface</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) GUI vs CLI</b>
                User Interface - program that allows user to control the functions of the operating system
                    GUI - Graphical User Interface - uses icons on the screen to manage different tasks on the computer

                    CLI - Command Line Interface - text based interface that uses commands to interact with the computer
                           can enter commands to run multiple tasks at once (ex: moving large groups of .jpg files from a folder)

        <b>02) Command Line in Use </b>
                Command Line is more efficient than GUI. 
                 CLI can accept multiple requests at one time 
                 History file -- can go back and look at previously run commands and be certain to run the same commands correctly

    <h2>04.06 All About Linux</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Welcome to wk 02</b>
                - Architecture of Linux
                - Different Distributions of Linux
                - The Shell

        <b>02) Introduction to Linux</b>
                Open-Source Operating System - top OS in security field 
                Linus Torvalds made Linux Kernel so people could use and improve UNIX system in early 90's
                Richard Stallman started GNU around the same time. 
                  the 2 shared a vision of open-source software and by using Torvalds Kernel with Stallman's GNU project Linux was created
                
                GNU Public License allows users to use, modify, and share many programs freely

                in security industry we will use Linux to: -examine logs
                                                           -verify access and authorization (to ensure system security)
                                                           -using digital forensic tools or offensive security pen testing tools      

        <b>03) Learn and Grow in the Cybersecurity Field</b>
                    Phil - always learn -- field is always changing 
                  build on the foundations of knowledge (this course)  

        <b>04) Linux Architecture</b>
                - User - person interacting with the computer
                - Applications - program that performs a specific task
                - Shell - Command-Line INTERPRETER (not interface)
                - File Hierarchy Standard - component of Linux OS that organizes data
                - Kernel - component of the OS that manages processes and memory. uses drivers and communicates with hardware to execute tasks
                - Hardware - physical components of the computer

        <b>05) Linux Architecture Explained</b>
                - User: intiate and manage computer tasks 
                - Applications: use package managers to install, manage, and remove packages & applications.
                   - Package = piece of software when combined that can form applications
                - Shell: command-line interpreter -- translates commands you enter into the computer to perform tasks
                - Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS): organizes data
                   - Directory: file that organizes where files are stored (aka Folder), can contain files and other directories
                - Kernel: communicates with applications to route commands. controls all major functions of the hardware
                - Hardware: physical components of the computer
                     -- Perpheral Devices: not core components of the system. ex: monitor, keyboar, mouse, printer, joystick, etc...
                     -- Internal Hardware: core components to run the system 
                        - Motherboard: the main circuit board that holds core components
                        - CPU: Central Processing Unit - performs general computing. executes instructions provided by applications
                        - Random Access Memory (RAM): used for short-term memory. data is stored at you perform tasks. cannot be accessed after system is shutdown
                        - Storage: long-term memory. where programs and files are stored. will be accessible after computer is restarted. 

        <b>06) Explore: Components of the Linus OS</b>
                - user - creates a new file 
                - application - user communicates with the shell 
                - shell - users command tell shell to create a new file 
                - file hierarchy system (FHS) - shell creates the file in the FHS
                - kernel - file information and location are passed to the kernel 
                - hardware - the kernel tells the hardware how and where to save the new file 
    </pre>
    <h2>04.07 Linux Distributions</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Linux Distributions</b>
                aka 'Flavor' - can be very customized for different user needs
               - Debian 
               - Ubuntu

               - kernel is like the engine of a car, makes it all run
              different distributions are used for different purposes 
              distros have different pre-installed software and interfaces
                 they contain: - kernel
                               - utilities
                               - package management system
                               - and installer  

              Debian --> Ubuntu and KALI                 
              RHEL --> CentOS
              Slackware --> SUSE

        <b>02) KALI Linux</b>
                trademark of 'Offensive Security' and is Debian Derived 
                    best to use KALI in VM for extra layer of security
               Penetration Test - simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, application, or processes
               
               KALI has numerous built in tools:  - Metasploit: look for and exploit vulnerabilities on the machine
                                                  - Burp Suite: helps test for weakness in web applications
                                                  - John the Ripper: used to guess passwords
                     
                    Digital Forensics - process of collecting and analyzing data to determine what has happened during an attack
                       ex: looking at data related to network activity. 
                           - tcpdump is a popular CLI based packet analyzer used to capture network traffic
                           - Wireshark is another popular GUI tool used to analyze and capture live network traffic
                           - Autopsy is a forensic tool to analyze hard disk and smartphones

    <h2>04.08 The Shell</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Introduction to the Shell</b>
                where the action happens for security analysts
              Command-Line Interpreter: pretty much the CLI (interface) - allows users to enter commands
              Command: instruction telling computer to do something  

              the shell is the language interpreter between the user and the system

              allows you to join multiple applications together to automate complex tasks

        <b>02) Different Types of Shells</b>
                allow users to give commands to system and receive response        
                - bash (Bourne-Again Shell)
                - csh (C Shell)
                - ksh (Korn Shell)
                - tcsh (Enhanced C Shell)
                - zsh (Z Shell)

                bash - default shell for most Linux distributions. we will use bash through this course.

        <b>03) Input and Output in the Shell</b>
                - Standard Input: information received by the OS via command line
                - Standart Output: information returned through the OS by the shell
                - Error Messages: error messages returned by the OS through the shell       

        <b>04) Activity: Examine Input and Output in the Shell</b>
                    expr - does basic math calculation (ex: expr 32 - 8    will return 24)
                    clear - clear the bash shell      
                    
        <b>05) Exemplar: Examine Input and Output in the Shell</b>

        <b>06) Strategies to Learn New Skills</b>
                <i>'I learn through practice and repetition. I watch a lot of programming and computing videos on YouTube and try to build projects and work on my personal networking lab at my house. The more I work on concepts the more I start to understand them. Sometimes it takes multiple ways of seeing information in different formats for me to really understand a difficult concepts, so I am always interested in hearing explanations from different sources to reenforce my knowledge. 
                    I love reading about setting up servers and communicating between computers, so playing around on the command line has become a common occurrence for me lately. I am really interested in learning Rust and some additional programming languages and using Linux for Virtual Machine creation, Docker container instances, and setting up local servers.

                - Use the Command Line
                - Navigating and Managing the Filesystem 
                - Authenticating and Authorizing Users
                - Accessing Resources

        <b>02) Linux Commands via the Bash Shell</b>
                Security Analysts: 
                     - work with server logs in Linux
                     - navigate, manage, and analyze files remotely without a GUI
                     - verify and configure users and group access
                     - give authorization and set file permissions

                user types in command and the OS responds after talking to the Kernel and Hardware
                 Command - instruction telling the computer to do something
                 $ before curser, root user # before curser    
                 
                 Argument (Linux) - Specific information needed by a command
                   ex: echo command uses text string as argument
                   ** in Linux all commands and arguments ARE CASE SENSITIVE 

        <b>03) Core Commands for Navigating and Reading Files</b>
                FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) - component of the Linux OS that organizes data
                    everything in Linux is considered a file  
               - Root: highest-level directory in Linux
                - subdirectories branch out from root directory, subdirectories can contain subdirectories    
                   ex: '/home/analyst' = the first / is the root directory, which branches out to the 'home' directory which branches into the 'analyst' directory
            - pwd - print working directory - prints working directory to screen   
            - ls - displays names of files and directories in the current working directory
            - cd - navigate between directories
            - cat - displays contents of a file
            - head - displays first 10 lines of a file, by default
            - tail - displays last 10 lines of a file, by default

        <b>04) Navigate Linux and Read File Content</b>
                Root directory /, each additional seperated by '/'
                 /home: each user on the system gets their own home directory 
                 /bin: binary = contains binary executable files 
                 /etc: directory stores system's configuration files 
                 /tmp: store temporary files  **commonly used by attackers because anyone in the system can modify these files**
                 /mnt: stands for mount and stores media such as USB drives and hard drives.

              - man (manual) - read information about how to use commands

            Absolute File Path: full file path, ex: '/home/analyst/projects'
            Relative File Path: file path that starts from user's current directory
            
            pwd - current working directory (print working directory)
            ls - list contents of current directory
            cd - change directory
            cat - display file contents
            head - first 10 lines of a file
            tail - last 10 lines of a file
            less - returns content one page at a time
               'less' controls
                  space bar = forward 1 page
                  b = move back 1 page
                  down arrow = forward 1 line
                  up arrow = move back 1 line
                  q = quit

    <h2>04.11 Manage File Content with Bash</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Find What You Need with Linux</b>
                filtering for information
            - grep - searches specified file and returns any instance of specified string 
                ex: $ grep OS updates.txt      -> will search the file updates.txt for the string 'OS' 
                   the grep command takes 2 arguments: 1st what you are searching for; 2nd what file to search 
            - | (piping) - used for a variety of purposes. used to join standard output of one command as standard input into another command for further processing
                ex: $ ls /home/analyst/reports | grep users       -> will output the contents of directory /home/analyst/reports; then seach that output for any occurrence of the word 'users'

        <b>02) Filter Content in Linux</b>
            - filtering: allows user to quickly filter files    
            - grep: searches specified file and returns all lines containing specified string; 
                       - commonly takes 2 arguements: 1) string & 2) file to search
                       - ex: $ grep OS updates.txt   --> searches for the string 'OS' in the file updates.txt
            - piping: | - takes the output of 1 command and inputs the output into the 2nd command
                       - ex: ls /home/analyst/reports | grep users -> will output the contents of directory /home/analyst/reports and then search that directory output for the string 'users' 
            - find: used to search directories and files for specified criteria 
               can searc files and directories based on: specific string in name, certain file size, last modified within certain time frame
                - -name: searches file and directory names for a specific string -- CASE SENSITIVE 
                    ex: $ find /home/analyst/projects -name "*log*"
                - -iname: same as -name, but NOT CASE SENSITIVE
                - -mtime: search files and directories for anything modified within a certain time
                    ex: $ find /home/analyst/projects -mtime -3      -> will return any files or directories changed within the last 3 days
                - -mmin: same as mtime: but modified within minutes instead of days    
        
        <b>03) Activity: Filter with grep</b>
                    using grep and 'ls | grep search'

        <b>04) Exemplar: Filter with grep</b>
        
        <b>05) Create and Modify Directories and Files</b>
                     making subdirectories and creating files
                - mkdir: creates new directory
                - rmdir: removes a directory 
                      ex: $ rmdir /home/analyst/reports/oldReports     --> will delete the folder 'oldReports' in the 'reports' directory
                - touch: creates a file
                      ex: $ touch email_patches.txt    --> will create the file email_patches.txt in the current directory 
                - rm: removes a file
                - mv: will move a file from one directory to another
                      ex: $ move email_patches.txt /home/analyst    --> will move the 'email_patches.txt' to the /analyst/ directory
                - cp: copy a file from current director to new directory
                      ex: $ cp email_patches.txt /home/analyst    --> copies the file and keeps a copy in the current directory        
            Nano -- used to edit and modify files            
                 ex: $ nano email_patches.txt    --> can edit the email_patches.txt
                 Ctrl-O = save changes
                 Ctrl-X = exit
        
        <b>06) Manage Directories and Files</b>
                 - mkdir: makes directory; ex: $ mkdir /home/analyst/reports/newProject    --> will make a folder named 'newProject' in the 'reports' folder
                 - rmdir: removes directory; ex: $ rmdir /home/analyst/reports/newProject    --> will delete the folder 'newProject' in the'reports' folder
                 - touch: creates a file; ex: $ touch newProject.txt      --> will create the file 'newProject.txt' in the current working folder
                 - rm: removes a file; ex: $ rm newProject.txt      --> will delete the file 'newProject.txt' in the current working folder
                 - mv: moves a file or directory do a different location; ex: $ mv newProject.txt /home/analysts/logs     --> will move the 'newProject.txt' to the /home/analysts/logs directory
                 - cp: copies a file or directory to a different location; ex: $ cp newProject.txt /home/analysts/logs     --> will copy the 'newProject.txt' to the /home/analysts/logs directory
                 - nano: text editor 
                 
               Standard Input and Standard Output and output redirection with Pipes |
                 - $ echo >  will overwrite data in a file
                         ex: $ echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
                 - $ echo >> will append data to the end of a file    
                         ex: $ echo "Hello World" >> hello.txt    --> will ammend the text after the 1st "Hello World"
                               - if you $ echo > "Hello Jeff"    --> it will overwrite the previous text and now contain "Hello Jeff"

    <h2>04.12 Authenticate and Authorize Users</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) File Permissions and Ownership</b>
            Permissions - type of access granted for a file or directory
            Authorization - granting specific access to specific resoureces in a system
                   allows you to limit access to files or directories 
            3 Linux Permissions:
                    - Read - can read a file, or all files in a directory
                    - Write - allow content to be modified in a file, can create and modify files in a directory
                    - Execute - allow files to be executed (if executable), can enter into directories and alter files 
            3 Linux Owners:
                    - Users - the owner of the file
                    - Group - consists of several users, 
                    - Other - anyone else on the system that isn't the user or part of the group

        File Permissions - ex: drwxrwxrwx  = a directory with full permissions for the user group 
            first 'd' = directory
              1st 'rwx' = read, write, execute -- permissions for the user
              2nd 'rwx' = permissions for the 'group'
              3rd 'rwx' = permissions for 'other'

           Options: modify the behavior of the command

           ls -la  = show permissions of all files (including hidden)
        
        <b>02) Change Permissions</b>
               chmod = changes permissions of files and directories (change mode)
                 ex: <i>chmod g+w, o-r access.txt</i>       - owner types seperated by comma
                    this will add 'write' permission to 'group' 
                          and remove the 'read' permission from 'other'
        
        <b>03) Permission Commands</b>
                read - file = read, directory = read contents for directory and file 
                write - file = write to file, directory = write to files in the directory
                execute - file = execute command files (executables), directory = enter directory and access files

               1st letter / - = directory or file
               2nd group of 3 letters = read, write, execute for 'user' == a hyphen = no permission
               3rd group of 3 letters = read, write, execute for 'group'
               4th group of 3 letters = ready, write, execute for 'other'
               
               ls -    = list
               ls -a   = list with hidden files
               ls -l   = list with permissions
               ls -la  = list with permissions and hidden files
               
            principle of least privlege = limit access to files and directories, unless access is required   

            chmod = change mode -- allows user to change permissions for files and directories in linux

            ex: <i>chmod u+rwx, g+rwx, o-rwx login_session.txt</i>
                  this would grant 'user' - read, write, execute file permission
                       would grant 'group' - read, write, execute file permission
                       and would remove 'other' -read, write, execute file permission

        <b>05) Portfolio Activity: Use Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions</b>
            You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

            Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

        <b>06) Add and Delete Users</b>
             Authentication = proving a user is who they say they are in the system
                adding new users to the system or to a group
                removing users from group if department changes, or from system if employment status changes
           
            Root user = superuser 
            
            security risk to stay logged in as root user; can make irreversible mistakes as root user 

            sudo = temporarily grant superuser permission ('Super User Do')
               -> must be given sudo access in 'sudoers' configuration file 
             
            useradd = adds a user to the system
                ex: sudo useradd salesrep7       - will add a user named 'salesrep7'
            
            userdel = delete a user from the system 
                ex: sudo userdel salesrep7       - they didn't last long at all     
        
        <b>07) Responsible Use of 'Sudo'</b>
            superuser =  Root user    
            sudo = temporarily grant superuser permission ('Super User Do')

            chmod = 
        
        for Authentication and Authorization
            useradd = add a user to the system 
                -g  = adds user to a primary group
                -G  = adds user to supplemental groups

            ex: <i>sudo useradd -g security fgarcia</i> - would add 'fgarcia' to the system with a primary group of 'security'   
            
            usermod = modifies an existing user 
                -g    = changes existing primary group 
                -G    = overwrites supplemental groups 
                -a -G = ammends supplemental groups 
                -d    = changes home directory
                -l    = changes login name 
                -L    = Locks account so no user login  
            
            ex: <i>sudo usermod -a -G marketing fgarcia</i>  - would ammend 'fgarcia' supplemental group list with 'marketing' group 
            ex02: <i>sudo usermod -L fgarcia</i> - would Lock 'fgarcia' account so that they could not signin

            userdel = delete a user from the system  (sometimes best to Lock account [usermod -L] first so you can view file ownership)
                -r    = deletes user and files from user home directory
            
            ex: <i>sudo userdel -r fgarcia</i>   - will remove user and home directory files from the system 
            
            chown = change ownership of file or directory
               enter ':' before group name to change group ownership 

            ex: <i>sudo chown fgarcia access.txt</i>   - changes 'fgarcia' to the owner of the access.txt file
            ex: <i>sudo chown :security fgarcia access.txt</i>   - changes 'fgarcia' to owner of the 'security' group -- ':' indicates it is a group

    <h2>04.15 Introduction to SQL and Databases</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Welcome to wk 04</b>
                - Relational Databases
                - SQL Queries
                - SQL Filters
                - SQL Joins

        <b>02) Introduction to Databases</b>
                <i>Database - organized collection of information / data</i>
                            stores more information than a spreadsheet; to share with larger groups or users than spreadsheets, also
                Databases can be stored by multiple users at 1 time, can store massive amounts of data
                   databases can perform complex tasks while accessing data. 
                
                <i>Relational Database - structured database containing tables that are related to each other</i>        
                    Tables contain fields of information      ex: employee table would have employee_id, device_id, username, etc... as fields on the table 
                        'fields' are the <b>columns</b> of the database
                    also contain records of information       ex: the specific information filled out in the columns
                        'records' are the <b>rows</b> of the database
                
                with relational databases we can have 1 table about employees and 1 table pertaining to machine information
                  we can then connect the 2 tables if they share a common column
                  the shared column is known as a <b>'key'</b>

                  2 types of keys: primary key = a column where every row has a unique entry; must not have any duplicate or null values
                                   foreign key = column in a table that is a primary key in another table; can contain empty / duplicate values

        <b>03) Query Databases with SQL</b>
                SQL (Structured Query Language) = programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database
                Query - request from data from a database table or a combination of tables
                Log - record of events that occur within an organization's systems

             cybersecurity analysts query logs to go over machine settings, review visitors on a web app and tasks they perform
                can find vulnerabilities and malicious activity by reviewing logs 

        <b>04) SQL Filtering versus Linux Filtering</b>
                <i>sqlite3</i> - linux command that will bring up sqlite

              Structure - SQL offers more structured filtering than Linux 
                 ex: access log of employee log-in attempts, SQL will have each record seperated into columns
                      linux simply prints the data as a line of text without additional organization 
                        SQL offers a more readable and adjustable result
                        
              Joining Tables - SQL allows analysts to join data from different tables, Linux does not offer that functionality
              
              **Best Uses** SQL cannot be used with .txt file and therefore you must filter with Linux

        <b>05) SQL in Cybersecurity</b>
                I need to take some additonal coursework on SQL to get a deeper understanding 
                  SQL is important to know in cybersecurity  
    </pre>
    <h2>04.16 SQL Queries</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Basic Queries</b>
                SELECT - indicates which column to return
                FROM - indicates which table to query
                    ex:  SELECT employee_id, device_id FROM employees;      (; semicolon is placed at end of statement)
                    ex:  SELECT * FROM employees;                           (will return all columns from the employees table)
                Syntax - rules that determine what is correctly structured in a computing language     
                    
        <b>02) Query a Database</b>
                    ex: <i>SELECT customer_id, city, country FROM customers;</i>
                    
                SELECT = which columns to return, select multiple columns by seperating with ',' comma
                
                FROM = which table to query

                ORDER BY = helps organize data
                    ex: SELECT customer_id, city, country FROM customers ORDER BY city;    
                        SQL will return customer_id, city, and country columns from 'customers' table with records sequenced by 'city' column     
                  also can sort ORDER BY with DESC order
                    ex: SELECT customer_id, city, country FROM customers ORDER BY city DESC;
                        add DESC to end and it will ORDER BY Descending order    
                  can also ORDER BY multiple columns
                    ex: SELECT customer_id, city, country FROM customers ORDER BY country, city; 
                        will return columns from table in order of 'country' then 'city'   
    
        <b>03) Resources for Completing SQL Labs</b>
    
        <b>04) Activity: Perform a SQL Query</b>
                SELECT device_id, operating_system, OS_patch_date FROM machines;

                SELECT username, login_date, login_time FROM log_in_attempts
    
        <b>05) Basic Filters on SQL Queries</b>
                Filtering - selecting data that matches certain conditions 
                  ex: filter for logins from specific country 
                
                Operator - symbol or keyword that represents an operation 
                  ex: country = 'USA'            -- the = operator finds records where the country field is USA

                WHERE - indicates the condition for a filter  
                  ex: WHERE country = 'USA'   
                  
               <i>SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE country = 'USA';</i>
               
               % acts as a wildcard when filtering - 
               ex: WHERE office LIKE 'East%';
                  you would get results East-120, East_Brooklyn, East150, Easterly... 

               LIKE - we must use LIKE instead of = when using the % wildcard operator    
    
        <b>06) The WHERE Clause and Basic Operators</b>
                <i>WHERE - indicates the condition for a filter</i>
                % wildcard and the LIKE operator

                other wildcards -- 

                'a_'    = as, an, a7, ...
                'a__'   = ash, ant, add, a1c, ...
                '%a'    = pizza, z6ra, a, ...
                '_a'    = ma, 1a, Ha, ...
                '%a%'   = Again, back, a, ...
                '_a_'   = Car, ban, ea7, ...

             LIKE -- operator used with wildcards (instead of =)

             ex: <i>SELECT lastname, firstname, title, email FROM employees WHERE title LIKE 'IT%'</i>
                will grab the last and firstname, the title and email from employees that match the filter criteria related to 'IT%', so any IT Staff, IT Manager, ... 

        <b>07) Activity: Filter a SQL Query</b>
               SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance';

               SELECT device_id, username, department, office FROM employees WHERE office LIKE 'South%';
    </pre>
    <h2>04.17 More SQL Filters</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Filter Dates and Numbers</b>
              Common Data Types -- 
                    String Data = consisting of an ordered sequence of characters, can be letters, numbers, and characters 
                    Numeric Data = consists of numbers
                    Date & Time Data = represents date and time
             
             numerical operators - =  equal
                                   >  greater than
                                   <  less than
                                   <> not equal         
                                   >= greater than or equal to
                                   <= less than or equal to  

            ex: <i>SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE time > '18:00';</i>
                will return all log-in attempts after 6pm (greater than 18:00 time)

        BETWEEN operator - filters for numbers of dates within a range
            ex: <i>SELECT * FROM machines WHERE OS_patch_date BETWEEN '2021-03-01' AND '2021-09-01'</i>
                this returns machines that have received OS patches between March 1st 2021 and September 1st 2021              

        <b>02) Operators for Filtering Dates and Numbers</b>
                inclusive operator - operator that includes the value of comparison (ex: >= )
                exclusive operator - operator that excludes the value of comparison (ex: > )
        
        <b>03) Activity: Apply more Filters in SQL</b>
            In this scenario, you’re investigating a recent security incident.

            You need to gather information about login attempts for certain dates and times. This will help in resolving a security incident.
        
            Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll retrieve login events made after a certain date. Second, you’ll narrow the focus of the search to filter logins in a date range. Third, you’ll investigate logins that were made at certain times. Finally, you’ll filter login attempts based on their event IDs.

            <i>SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_date > '2022-05-09'</i>
            <i>SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_date BETWEEN '' AND ''</i>
            <i>SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_time < '07:00:00';</i>
            <i>SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_time BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '07:00:00' ORDER BY login_time;</i>
            <i>SELECT event_id, username, login_date FROM log_in_attempts WHERE event_id >= 100;</i>
            <i>SELECT event_id, username, login_date FROM log_in_attempts WHERE event_id BETWEEN 100 AND 150;</i>
        
        <b>04) Filters AND, OR, and NOT</b>
                AND - Multiple conditions must be met, specifies that both conditions must be met simultaneously.
                  ex: <i>SELECT * FROM machines WHERE operating_system = 'OS 1' AND email_client = 'Email Client 1';</i>

                OR  - either condition can be met
                  ex: <i>SELECT * FROM machines WHERE operating_system = 'OS 1' OR operating_system = 'OS 3';</i>  
                
                NOT - negates a condition
                  ex: <i>SELECT * FROM machines WHERE NOT operating_system = 'OS 3';</i>

        <b>05) More on Filters with AND, OR, and NOT</b>
                AND - filters 2 conditions and specifies that both are met
                   ex: <i>SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country, supportrepid FROM customers WHERE supportrepid = 5 AND country = 'USA';</i>

                OR - filters 2 conditions and specifies either can be met
                   ex: <i>SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
                        FROM customers
                        WHERE country = 'Canada' OR country = 'USA';</i> 

                NOT - only works on a single condition -- this operator negates a condition, SQL returns records that DO NOT match the conditions of query
                  <> & != are both the same operator as NOT -- the following examples give the same results 
                   ex: WHERE NOT country = 'USA';
                   ex02: WHERE country <> 'USA';
                   ex03: WHERE country != 'USA';

                Combining Logical Operators:

                can use AND and NOT together-
                   ex: WHERE NOT country = 'Canada' AND NOT country = 'USA';
                   ex02: WHERE coutry != 'Canada' AND country != 'USA';
        
        <b>06) Activity: Filter with AND, OR, and NOT</b>
            In this scenario, you need to obtain specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they belong to from the database.

            Your team needs data to investigate potential security issues and to update computers.
        
            You are responsible for filtering the required information from the database.
        
            Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll retrieve all failed login attempts after business hours. Second, you’ll retrieve all login attempts that occurred on specific dates. Third, you’ll retrieve logins that didn't originate in Mexico. Fourth, you’ll retrieve information about certain employees in the Marketing department. Fifth, you’ll retrieve information about employees in the Finance or the Sales department. Finally, you’ll obtain information about employees who are not in the Information Technology department.

            <i>SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = 0;</i>
                       success = 0 (false) in SQL, boolean is represented as 'true' 1, or 'false' 0
            <i>SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_date = '2002-05-09' OR login_date '2022-05-08';</i>
            <i>SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE NOT country LIKE 'MEX%'</i>   
            <i>SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'East%';</i>
            <i>SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';</i>    
            <i>SELECT * FROM employees WHERE NOT department = 'Information Technology';</i>

        <b>07) Portfolio Activity: Apply Filters to SQL Queries</b>
        You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

        Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.
        
        Note: This scenario involves the same queries as the ones the Filter with AND, OR, and NOT 
         lab. If you choose, it's also possible to complete this activity without revisiting the lab by typing your queries in the template.

    <h2>04.18 SQL Joins</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Join Tables in SQL</b>
                employees.employee_id    = the 'employee_id' column on the 'employees' table
                machines.employee_id      - the 'employee_id' column on the 'machines' table

               INNER JOIN = return rows matching on a specified column that exists in more than 1 table
                  ex: <i>SELECT username, office, operating_system FROM employees INNER JOIN machines ON employees.employee_id = machines.employee_id;</i>

        <b>02) Types of Joins</b>
                INNER JOIN: returns matching rows of data from both tables
                LEFT JOIN: returns all of the first table with matching from 2nd
                    ex: <i></i> 
                RIGHT JOIN: returns all of the second table with matching from 1st table
                    ex: <i></i>
                FULL OUTER JOIN: returns both tables
                    ex: <i></i>

        <b>03) Compare Types of Joins</b>
                INNER JOIN: only returns rows where there is a match 
                    ex: <i>SELECT * FROM employees INNER JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;</i>
                LEFT JOIN: returns all of 1st table and matching rows from 2nd table
                    ex: <i>SELECT * FROM employees LEFT JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;</i>
                RIGHT JOIN: returns all of 2nd table and matching rows from 1st 
                    ex: <i>SELECT * FROM employees RIGHT JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;</i>
                FULL OUTER JOIN: returns all records from both tables
                    ex: <i>SELECT * FROM employees FULL OUTER JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machine.device_id;</i>

        <b>04) Identify: Choose the Appropriate Type of Join</b>

        <b>05) Activity: Complete a Join</b>
                In this scenario, you’ll investigate a recent security incident that compromised some machines.

                You are responsible for getting the required information from the database for the investigation.
        
                Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll use an inner join to identify which employees are using which machines. Second, you’ll use left and right joins to find machines that do not belong to any specific user and users who do not have any specific machine assigned to them. Finally, you’ll use an inner join to list all login attempts made by all employees.

                <i>SELECT * FROM machines INNER JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;</i>

                <i>SELECT * FROM machines LEFT JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;</i>

                <i>SELECT * FROM machines RIGHT JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;</i>

                <i>SELECT * FROM employees INNER JOIN log_in_attempts ON employees.username = log_in_attempts.username;</i>

        <b>06) Reading: Continous Learning in SQL</b>
                Aggregate Functions:
                    COUNT: returns a single number that represents the number of rows returned from your query 
                    <i>SELECT COUNT(firstname) FROM customers;</i>   -- will count the # entries in the firstname, excluding NULL values
                    <i>SELECT COUNT(firstname) FROM customers WHERE country = 'US';</i>

                    AVG: returns single number that represents the average of the numerical data in a column 
                    <i>SELECT AVG(age) FROM customers WHERE sex = 'M';</i>
                    
                    SUM: returns single number that represents the sum of the numerical data in a column
                    <i>SELECT SUM(household) FROM customers;</i>

        <b>07) Discussion: SQL and the Security Analyst</b>
            <i>'I never realized that SQL was so easily executed through the Linux Command Line. I plan on taking an additional course in SQL after I complete the Coursera Google Cybersecurity coursework. SQL is a powerful and complex tool to have access to. 

                Being able to query information from datasets quickly will inform decisions. Having data to backup a cybersecurity analysts suggestions are key to communicating with their team and with all stakeholders.'</i>

             <i>'I really enjoy using Linux and open source software anytime possible and now I am very interested in starting and maintaining a database simply to play with and explore it over time. SQL is a powerful side language that I want to spend additional time learning and utilizing for efficient gaining of information. 
                While going through data it would be useful to be able to compare log data between tables. I can see myself having to use SQL often through my career in cybersecurity. I am going to continue to use Linux and practice creating Docker containerized servers. I also want to start scrubbing data and creating a database so that I can query and manipulate the datasets I create.'</i>
