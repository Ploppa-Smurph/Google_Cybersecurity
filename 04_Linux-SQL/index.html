            <i>"I am currently on summer break from an Associates in Applied Sciences degree in Cybersecurity at a local community college. I wanted to take this class to reenforce my knowledge and to fill in any gaps that my other courses may have missed. In the 3 courses I have completed from the Coursera Google course there has been a wealth of information, some things I have yet to cover in the college courses. 
                I am familiar with Linux and have used SQL before, but I look forward to practicing any relevant knowledge that deals with the cybersecurity industry. I have taken coursework on networks before and on working with databases and am always happy to learn more about how these will relate to my chosen career field. 
                I hope to see more real world situational examples so that I can relate my knowledge to actual events that I might come across at work, in the future. I am looking forward to being exposed to more tools and utilities that I will work with in my upcoming career.

        <b>03) Introduction to Operating Systems</b>
                OS - interface between hardware and user
                Hardware - physical components of computer system
                Windows 
                MacOS

        <b>05) Discussion: Your Background in Operating Systems</b>
                <i>'I have grown up around computers and have lots of experience using different Operating Systems. I have both Windows and Linux computers, including RHEL, Rocky, Ubuntu, Manjaro, Kali, and more. The first computer system I had ran Microsoft Dos and was all command line interface. Through the years I realized that I have a lot of experience with different Operating Systems, but no necessarily a lot of knowledge about the more powerful tools and utilities that are available. The main reason I am trying to enter into the Cybersecurity field is because I want a career instead of another job and I want to learn and better utilize the power and potential of my home network. 
                    I use Windows 11 on a day to day basis with my school work and through my home network, I also use Manjaro and Ubuntu fairly regularly because I have a couple of servers set up on those systems. I really want to know more about how to communicate between my Linux and Windows systems. I have been able to SSH between the systems, but I want to see about linking the servers in with my network more easily. I am hoping to continue to learn so that I will be able to ask the right questions and find the correct answers.

    <h2>04.03 Operating Systems at Work</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Inside the Operating System</b>
                  1) boot computer - interact with hardware - starts BIOS / UEFI - which contains the booting instructions from the Bootloader
                  2) bootloader starts the OS 
                 
              Users use Applications to interact with the OS, the OS then interacts with the system Hardware
                the Hardware returns information to the OS and the OS then returns to the Application     
        
        <b>02) Requests to the Operating System</b>
                - First, the user decides they want to download a file that they found online, so they click on a download button near the file in the internet browser application.
                - Then, the internet browser communicates this action to the OS.
                - The OS sends the request to download the file to the appropriate hardware for processing.
                - The hardware begins downloading the file, and the OS sends this information to the internet browser application. The internet browser then informs the user when the file has been downloaded.
    
        <b>03) Practice: Order of Operations in the OS</b>
        
        <b>04) Resource Allocation via the OS</b>
                the OS handles Resource and Memory management 

        <b>05) Virtualization Technology</b>
                VM - Virtual Machine = software representation of physical computer hardware
               
              Security - creates an isolated environment 
                                ** some malicious code can escape and infect a host machine
              Efficiency - can utilize more physical resources by creating additional virtual machines
                             ex: car vs bus -- bus can hold more people and is more efficient
              Managing Virtual Resources - manage through the Hypervisor 
                  we will use KVM (Kernel-Based Virtual Machine), a common Linux hypervisor                      
    </pre>
    <h2>04.04 User Interface</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) GUI vs CLI</b>
                User Interface - program that allows user to control the functions of the operating system
                    GUI - Graphical User Interface - uses icons on the screen to manage different tasks on the computer

                    CLI - Command Line Interface - text based interface that uses commands to interact with the computer
                           can enter commands to run multiple tasks at once (ex: moving large groups of .jpg files from a folder)

        <b>02) Command Line in Use </b>
                Command Line is more efficient than GUI. 
                 CLI can accept multiple requests at one time 
                 History file -- can go back and look at previously run commands and be certain to run the same commands correctly

    <pre>
        <b>01) Welcome to wk 02</b>
                - Architecture of Linux
                - Different Distributions of Linux
                - The Shell

        <b>02) Introduction to Linux</b>
                Open-Source Operating System - top OS in security field 
                Linus Torvalds made Linux Kernel so people could use and improve UNIX system in early 90's
                Richard Stallman started GNU around the same time. 
                  the 2 shared a vision of open-source software and by using Torvalds Kernel with Stallman's GNU project Linux was created
                
                GNU Public License allows users to use, modify, and share many programs freely

                in security industry we will use Linux to: -examine logs
                                                           -verify access and authorization (to ensure system security)
                                                           -using digital forensic tools or offensive security pen testing tools      

        <b>03) Learn and Grow in the Cybersecurity Field</b>
                    Phil - always learn -- field is always changing 
                  build on the foundations of knowledge (this course)  

        <b>04) Linux Architecture</b>
                - User - person interacting with the computer
                - Applications - program that performs a specific task
                - Shell - Command-Line INTERPRETER (not interface)
                - File Hierarchy Standard - component of Linux OS that organizes data
                - Kernel - component of the OS that manages processes and memory. uses drivers and communicates with hardware to execute tasks
                - Hardware - physical components of the computer

        <b>05) Linux Architecture Explained</b>
                - User: intiate and manage computer tasks 
                - Applications: use package managers to install, manage, and remove packages & applications.
                   - Package = piece of software when combined that can form applications
                - Shell: command-line interpreter -- translates commands you enter into the computer to perform tasks
                - Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS): organizes data
                   - Directory: file that organizes where files are stored (aka Folder), can contain files and other directories
                - Kernel: communicates with applications to route commands. controls all major functions of the hardware
                - Hardware: physical components of the computer
                     -- Perpheral Devices: not core components of the system. ex: monitor, keyboar, mouse, printer, joystick, etc...
                     -- Internal Hardware: core components to run the system 
                        - Motherboard: the main circuit board that holds core components
                        - CPU: Central Processing Unit - performs general computing. executes instructions provided by applications
                        - Random Access Memory (RAM): used for short-term memory. data is stored at you perform tasks. cannot be accessed after system is shutdown
                        - Storage: long-term memory. where programs and files are stored. will be accessible after computer is restarted. 

        <b>06) Explore: Components of the Linus OS</b>
                - user - creates a new file 
                - application - user communicates with the shell 
                - shell - users command tell shell to create a new file 
                - file hierarchy system (FHS) - shell creates the file in the FHS
                - kernel - file information and location are passed to the kernel 
                - hardware - the kernel tells the hardware how and where to save the new file 
    </pre>
    <h2>04.07 Linux Distributions</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Linux Distributions</b>
                aka 'Flavor' - can be very customized for different user needs
               - Debian 
               - Ubuntu

               - kernel is like the engine of a car, makes it all run
              different distributions are used for different purposes 
              distros have different pre-installed software and interfaces
                 they contain: - kernel
                               - utilities
                               - package management system
                               - and installer  

              Debian --> Ubuntu and KALI                 
              RHEL --> CentOS
              Slackware --> SUSE

        <b>02) KALI Linux</b>
                trademark of 'Offensive Security' and is Debian Derived 
                    best to use KALI in VM for extra layer of security
               Penetration Test - simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, application, or processes
               
               KALI has numerous built in tools:  - Metasploit: look for and exploit vulnerabilities on the machine
                                                  - Burp Suite: helps test for weakness in web applications
                                                  - John the Ripper: used to guess passwords
                     
                    Digital Forensics - process of collecting and analyzing data to determine what has happened during an attack
                       ex: looking at data related to network activity. 
                           - tcpdump is a popular CLI based packet analyzer used to capture network traffic
                           - Wireshark is another popular GUI tool used to analyze and capture live network traffic
