        <b>02) Course 04 Overview</b>
                1) intro to OS\
                2) Linux OS
                3) Linux Commands in Bash
                4) Databases and SQL
    
        <b>03) Connect with Classmates</b>
            <i>"I am currently on summer break from an Associates in Applied Sciences degree in Cybersecurity at a local community college. I wanted to take this class to reenforce my knowledge and to fill in any gaps that my other courses may have missed. In the 3 courses I have completed from the Coursera Google course there has been a wealth of information, some things I have yet to cover in the college courses. 
                I am familiar with Linux and have used SQL before, but I look forward to practicing any relevant knowledge that deals with the cybersecurity industry. I have taken coursework on networks before and on working with databases and am always happy to learn more about how these will relate to my chosen career field. 
                I hope to see more real world situational examples so that I can relate my knowledge to actual events that I might come across at work, in the future. I am looking forward to being exposed to more tools and utilities that I will work with in my upcoming career.

    <h2>04.02 Wonderful World of Operating Systems</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Welcome to wk 01</b>
                - Common OSs and Functions of the OS
                - OS, Hardware, and Applications
                - Graphical User Interface, Command Line Interface
    
        <b>02) My Journey into Computing (Kim)</b>
                  interested in protecting people, interested in protecting information    
                    
        <b>03) Introduction to Operating Systems</b>
                OS - interface between hardware and user
                Hardware - physical components of computer system
                Windows 
                MacOS
                Android
                iOS
                Linux 

                computers use Binary -- OS helps people communicate more naturally
        
        <b>04) Compare Operating Systems</b>
                linux is open-source, popular in security sector

                Legacy OS - outdated, but still being used -- can be vulnerable because they are outdated

        <b>05) Discussion: Your Background in Operating Systems</b>
                <i>'I have grown up around computers and have lots of experience using different Operating Systems. I have both Windows and Linux computers, including RHEL, Rocky, Ubuntu, Manjaro, Kali, and more. The first computer system I had ran Microsoft Dos and was all command line interface. Through the years I realized that I have a lot of experience with different Operating Systems, but no necessarily a lot of knowledge about the more powerful tools and utilities that are available. The main reason I am trying to enter into the Cybersecurity field is because I want a career instead of another job and I want to learn and better utilize the power and potential of my home network. 
                    I use Windows 11 on a day to day basis with my school work and through my home network, I also use Manjaro and Ubuntu fairly regularly because I have a couple of servers set up on those systems. I really want to know more about how to communicate between my Linux and Windows systems. I have been able to SSH between the systems, but I want to see about linking the servers in with my network more easily. I am hoping to continue to learn so that I will be able to ask the right questions and find the correct answers.

    <h2>04.03 Operating Systems at Work</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Inside the Operating System</b>
                  1) boot computer - interact with hardware - starts BIOS / UEFI - which contains the booting instructions from the Bootloader
                  2) bootloader starts the OS 
                 
              Users use Applications to interact with the OS, the OS then interacts with the system Hardware
                the Hardware returns information to the OS and the OS then returns to the Application     
        
        <b>02) Requests to the Operating System</b>
                - First, the user decides they want to download a file that they found online, so they click on a download button near the file in the internet browser application.
                - Then, the internet browser communicates this action to the OS.
                - The OS sends the request to download the file to the appropriate hardware for processing.
                - The hardware begins downloading the file, and the OS sends this information to the internet browser application. The internet browser then informs the user when the file has been downloaded.
    
        <b>03) Practice: Order of Operations in the OS</b>
        
        <b>04) Resource Allocation via the OS</b>
                the OS handles Resource and Memory management 

        <b>05) Virtualization Technology</b>
                VM - Virtual Machine = software representation of physical computer hardware
               
              Security - creates an isolated environment 
                                ** some malicious code can escape and infect a host machine
              Efficiency - can utilize more physical resources by creating additional virtual machines
                             ex: car vs bus -- bus can hold more people and is more efficient
              Managing Virtual Resources - manage through the Hypervisor 
                  we will use KVM (Kernel-Based Virtual Machine), a common Linux hypervisor
