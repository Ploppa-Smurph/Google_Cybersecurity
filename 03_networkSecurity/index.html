        <b>03) What are Networks?</b>
                  a network is a group of connected devices
                    home network = printer, laptop, desktop, smart tv, etc...
                    office network = workstations, printer, servers, etc... 
                IP address: 
                MAC address: 
                LAN (Local Area Network): spans small area, house, office, school, etc...
                WAN (Wide Area Network): much larger area, city, state, country -=- the Internet is the largest WAN 
        
        <b>04) Working in Network Security</b>
                  keep network systems safe and resilient  
            always keep learning -- team sport

        <b>05) Useful Skills for Network Security</b>
                simulate advesaries and threats
                  - programming
                  - operational and platform security 
                  - command line = allows you to interact with low levels of the operating system like memory and higher level like applications
                  - log parsing = helps in debugging and finding root issues
                  - network traffic analysis = looking across network and application layers to see what traffic is doing
                      -Could passwords be getting leaked? 
                      -Is the infrastructure secure?
                      -Are firewalls being readily configured securely?
        
        <b>06) Network Tools</b>
                Hub: broadcasts to ALL devices
                Switch: broadcasts to specific device or devices, more intelligent than a hub. only passes data to intended device
                Router: connects multiple networks together
                Modem: connects router to the internet, brings internet to the LAN
                Virtualization Tools: software that perform network operations, offered by cloud service providers 

        <b>07) Network Components, Devices, and Diagrams</b>
            <img src="../networkDevices.png" alt="network device layout" />
              
            MAC Address - unique to each device. first half of address = manufacturer information
            IP Address - assigned to device, most dynamic now - servers often have assigned IP addresses
            Firewalls - network security device that monitors traffic. Can restrict specific incoming and outgoing network traffic. often reside between secured internal network and untrusted outside sources (ie: the internet)
            Servers - provide services (web hosting, email, DNS Server, File Server, etc..) part of the Client-Server Model
            Hubs - direct traffic to ALL, not as secure as Switch
            Switch - directs network traffic, more secure than Hub because it directs traffic to intended destination ONLY
            Modems - Interface to ISP - send and receive traffic form the internet and translates into digital signals that devices on the network can understand.
            Wireless Access Point - uses radio waves for wireless communication.
                Wi-Fi: set of standards used by network devices to communicate wirelessly
            Network Diagrams - topographical map that shows devices on the network and how they connect. 

        <b>08) Design a Local Area Network</b>
        
        <b>09) Cloud Networks</b>
                    not locally hosted
                        can reduce cost by being more flexible
                Cloud Computing = using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of local physical devices
                 Cloud Network = collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote data centers that can be accessed via the internet
                    Cloud providers offer:
                        - on-demand storage
                        - processing power as needed
                        - analytics for monitoring web traffic         
        
        <b>10) Cloud Computing and Software-defined Networks</b>
                    - Software as a service (SaaS) refers to software suites operated by the CSP that a company can use remotely without hosting the software. 
                    - Infrastructure as a service (Iaas) refers to the use of virtual computer components offered by the CSP. These include virtual containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web console. Cloud-compute and storage services can be used to operate existing applications and other technology workloads without significant modifications. Existing applications can be modified to take advantage of the availability, performance, and security features that are unique to cloud provider services.
                    - Platform as a service (PaaS) refers to tools that application developers can use to design custom applications for their company. Custom applications are designed and accessed in the cloud and used for a company’s specific business needs.
                Hybrid environment - both Cloud and On-site networks are utilized
                Software Defined Networks (SDNs) - made of virtual network devices and services, virtual switches, routers, and firewalls 

                What are the benefits of cloud computing and virtual networking?
                      Reliability: more available to more people across the globe with minimal interruption
                      Cost: costs less than having to buy all the hardware to build data centers
                      Scalability: can easily add or remove features as needed extremely quickly and easily

<h2>03.03 Network Communication</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Introduction to Network Communication</b>
                  Communication - sending data packets from one point to another
                  Data Packets - have information about sender, receiver, and content of message
                   Header - contains IP address and MAC address of destination device, also contains "Protocol Number" that tells receiving device what to do with the information
                   Body - contains data that needs to be transmitted during communication
                   Footer - tells the receiving device that the communication is complete
                
                Network Performance is measured by 'Bandwidth'
                 Bandwidth = amount of data a device receives every second 
                
                Packet Sniffing - practice of capturing and inspecting data packets sent across the network

        <b>02) TCP/IP Model</b>
                Transmission Control Protocol - internet communication protocol that allows 2 devices to connect and stream data 
                Internet Protocol - set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on the internet
                Port - software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network
                    Port 25 - email communication
                    Port 443 - Secure Internet communication (HTTPS)
                    Port 20 - Large File Transfers
                
        <b>03) 4 layers of TCP/IP</b>
                TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across the network
                   1. Network Access Layer - deals with the creation of data packets and their transmission across the network
                            - includes hardware devices                   
                   2. Internet Layer - where IP address is attactched to indicate location of sender and receiver. 
                            - focus on how networks communicate - handles LAN communication or sending out to WAN
                   3. Transport Layer - controls flow of traffic across the network. permit or deny communications with other devices and includes connection status information
                            - error control / handling
                   4. Application Layer - protocols determine how data packets will interact with the receiving device
                            - functions organized at application layer include file transfers and email services
        
        <b>04) Learn More about TCP/IP</b>
                1 - Network Access Layer = Ethernet vs Wireless (and more)
                2 - Internet Layer = IP (v4, v6)
                3 - Transport Layer = TCP v UDP (and more)
                4 - Application Layer = HTTP, TLS, DNS, etc... 

                Network Access Layer (aka Data Link Layer) - hubs, modems, cables and wiring are part of this layer
                        - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is part of the Network Access Layer
                           ARP assists IP with directing data packets on the same physical network by mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses.
                Internet Layer (aka Network Layer) - responsible for ensuirng delivery to destination. 
                        - IP (Internet Protocol) - sends data packets to the correct destination. IP packets allow communication between two networks
                        - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) - shares information and status updates of data packets. useful for detecting and troubleshooting network errors.
                                ICMP reports information about packets that were dropped 
                Transport Layer - responsible for transmitting data to destination.
                        - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - ensures data is reliably transmitted to the destination
                        - User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - not concerned with reliability of transmission - performance sensitive applications like video streaming
                Application Layer - similar to Application, Presentation, and Session layers of OSI model. responsible for making network requests and responding to requests. 
                    defines which internet services and applications users can access. 
                         - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
                         - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
                         - Secure Shell (SSH)
                         - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
                         - Domain Name System (DNS)
                TCP/IP combines multiple OSI model layers into each layer (TCP/IP has 4 layers, OSI has 7 Layers)                               

        <b>05) the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model</b>
                the TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across networks.

            the OSI model is a standerdized concept that describes the 7 layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network
                1. Physical Layer - corresponds to physical hardware. Hubs, Modems, Cables and Wiring 
                2. Data Link Layer - sending and receiving data packets within a single network - Switches and NIC (Network Interface Cards) on LANs
                3. Network Layer - oversees receiving frames from data link (layer 2) and deliving to intended destination
                        ex: Data Packets allow communication between 2 networks.
                4. Transport Layer - responsible for delivering data between devices. handles data transfer, flow and breaking data down to smaller data packets
                        ex: TCP and UPD are transport layer protocols
                5. Session Layer - describes when connection is established between 2 devices.  
                        ex: authentication, reconnection, setting checkpoints of data transfer
                6. Presentation Layer - Data translation and encryption for the network, processes at the presentation layer require a standardized format.
                        ex: encryption, compression, etc... take place. 1 example of encryption takes place at this layer is SSL to encrypt data for HTTPS
                7. Application Layer - processes directly involving everyday users; <i>'user connection to the network via applications and request'</i>
                        ex: browsers utilize HTTP / HTTPS and also DNS to translate web domain names to IP addresses; email uses SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send and receive email

<h2>03.04 Local and Wide Network Communication</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) IP Addresses and Network Communication</b>
               unique sting of characters that identifies a device on the network 
             IPv4 = 192.10.0.15 - 4 sets = total of 4 bytes of address info
             IPv6 = 684D:1111:222:3333:4444:5555:6:77 - 32 characters = total of 16 bytes of address info

             Public address = assigned by ISP, outward facing IP address
             Private address = only seen by devices on the same local network

             MAC address = alphanumeric identifier assigned to each physical device. 
                    switches map MAC address to devices on network and creates MAC Address Table
                    
        <b>02) Components for Network Layer Communications</b>
                IPv6 data packet header is simpler than IPv4 
                    13 parts of IPv4 header:
                        Version: The first 4-bit header tells receiving devices what protocol the packet is using. The packet used in the illustration above is an IPv4 packet.
                        IP Header Length (HLEN): HLEN is the packet’s header length. This value indicates where the packet header ends and the data segment begins. 
                        Type of Service (ToS): Routers prioritize packets for delivery to maintain quality of service on the network. The ToS field provides the router with this information.
                        Total Length: This field communicates the total length of the entire IP packet, including the header and data. The maximum size of an IPv4 packet is 65,535 bytes.
                        Identification: For IPv4 packets that are larger than 65, 535 bytes, the packets are divided, or fragmented, into smaller IP packets. The identification field provides a unique identifier for all the fragments of the original IP packet so that they can be reassembled once they reach their destination.                     
                        Flags: This field provides the routing device with more information about whether the original packet has been fragmented and if there are more fragments in transit.
                        Fragmentation Offset: The fragment offset field tells routing devices where in the original packet the fragment belongs.
                        Time to Live (TTL): TTL prevents data packets from being forwarded by routers indefinitely. It contains a counter that is set by the source. The counter is decremented by one as it passes through each router along its path. When the TTL counter reaches zero, the router currently holding the packet will discard the packet and return an ICMP Time Exceeded error message to the sender. 
                        Protocol: The protocol field tells the receiving device which protocol will be used for the data portion of the packet.
                        Header Checksum: The header checksum field contains a checksum that can be used to detect corruption of the IP header in transit. Corrupted packets are discarded.
                        Source IP Address: The source IP address is the IPv4 address of the sending device.
                        Destination IP Address: The destination IP address is the IPv4 address of the destination device.
                        Options: The options field allows for security options to be applied to the packet if the HLEN value is greater than five. The field communicates these options to the routing devices.

<h2>03.06 Introduction to Network Protocols</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Welcome to wk 02</b>
                -Network Protocols
                -VPNs (Virtual Private Network)
                -Firewalls, Security Zones, and Proxy Servers

        <b>02) Network Protocols</b>
                <i>Network Protocols are a set of rules used by 2 or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and structure of data</i>   
                ex: a) when accessing a website, your device first uses TCP to establish a connection to the web server.
                     -TCP allows 2 devices to connect and stream data, TCP also verifies both devices (handshake)
                    b) the connection is established after the web server responds and sends data packets. the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) helps get the data to the correct MAC address
                    c) now we can access the website, HTTPS allows webbrowsers to more securely send and receive data across the internet
                      -HTTPS uses SSL/TLS for a Secure Socket Layer and Transport Layer Security to encrypt data and send securely across the internet
                    d) DNS or Domain Name Server translates the IP address to a web address

        <b>03) Common Network Protocols</b>
                <b>Communication Protocols</b>
                    - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): allows 2 devices to connect. (happens at Transport Layer of TCP/IP model)
                        3 way handshake = device sends SYN request -> server responds with SYN/ACK to acknowledge -> then TCP connection is established 
                    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol): connectionless protocol, less reliable than TCP. UPD happens at Transport Layer
                    - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Application Layer Protocol - uses Port 80. communicate between browser and server
                    - DNS (Domain Name Server): translates IP address into domain name. DNS occurs at Application layer -- uses UDP & port 53 (default)
                <b>Management Protocols</b>
                    - SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol): monitor and manage devices on internet - SNMP occurs at Application Layer
                    - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): used to troubleshoot network connectivity isses, ICMP occurs at Internet Layer
                <b>Security Protocols</b>
                    - HTTPS (Hypertext Protocol Secure): Port 443; Application Layer.
                    - SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol): TCP port 22 (SSH); SFTP uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standar). SFTP occurs at Application Layer 

        <b>04) Additional Network Protocols</b>
                IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority):
                    Private IP Ranges:

        <b>01) Firewalls and Network Security Measures</b>
                <i>Firewall is a network security device that monitors traffic to and from your network</i>
                Port Filtering: blocking or allowing certain ports to limit unwanted communication
                Stateful: keeps track of information passing through it and proactively filters threats
                Stateless: operate on predefined rules, does not keep track of data packets 

                Hardware: most basic, a physical piece of hardware
                Software: software used like a physical firewall, does require some processing power since it is software
                Cloud: FaaS - Firewall as a Service - protects onsite computers and cloud held data 

                NGFW (Next Gen Firewall): more secure that stateful, has deep packet inspection and Intrusion Detection 
                Proxy server: 

        <b>02) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</b>
                 changes Public IP address to hide location so as to keep data private when using a public network (ie: the internet)
                <i>Encapsulation</i> - wrapping data packet inside other data packets to protect sensitive data

        <b>03) Security Zones</b>
                segment of the network that protects the internal network from the internet
                Network Segmentation: security technique that divides network into segments each with their own access permissions and security rules
                  ex: guest wi-fi at coffee shop or hotel, there is a seperate password protected connection for business operations 
                Subnets - maintains privacy for different departments in a domain  

                Uncontolled Security Zone: all networks outside of an organization's control
                Controlled Security Zone: area to protect the internal network
                   DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): Contains Web-servers, Proxy servers, DNS servers, E-mail, File Servers for external communication
                   Internal Network: Private data the organization needs to protect
                   Restricted Zone: only accessible to certain employees in the internal network, more secure
                should have DMZ between 2 firewalls - 1st filters traffic outside DMZ, 2nd filters traffic moving into internal network 
                    there would be an additional firewall between the internal network and restricted zone

        <b>04) Subnetting and CIDR</b>
                Subnetting = creates smaller networks inside a network. can be used to create security zones.  
                CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation for Subnetting 
                  ex: 198.51.100.0/24 will encompass all IP addresses 198.51.100.0 - 198.51.100.255

        <b>05) Proxy Servers</b>
                secures Internal network
              Proxy Server = server that fulfills requests of clients by forwarding them to another server  
               proxy servers also cache external data and save time on repetative calls
              Forward Proxy Server = regulates and restricts access to the internet - GOAL: hide IP address and approve outgoing request
              Reverse Proxy Server = regulates internet's access to internal server - GOAL: accept incoming traffic, approve it and forward to the internal servers
              E-mail Proxy Server = filters spam by verifying senders address wasn't forged

        <b>02) the Case for Securing Networks</b>
                common network intrusions:
                  - Malware
                  - Spoofing
                  - Packet Sniffing
                  - Packet Flooding 
                hacks can hurt an organization by: 
                   - leaking valuable or confidential information
                   - damaging an organization's reputation
                   - impacting customer retention  
                   - can cost money and time
             ex: recent hack 2014 Home Depot was hacked and 56 million customers were affected      

        <b>03) How Intrusions Compromise Your System</b>
                Network Interception Attacks: packet sniffing - can alter messages, interupt network operations
                        malicious packet sniffing, on-path attack, and replay attack
                
                Backdoor Attacks: find an open way to install malware, perform DoS attack (DoS floods network / server with network traffic so it cannot respond)
                
                Impacts from intrusions: 
                 - Financial: normal operations could be affected causing loss of money

        <b>01) Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks</b>
              <i>An attack that targets a network / server and floods it with network traffic</i>
              objective: interupt everyday operations by overloading system, causing crash or inabiltiy to handle legitimate request 
              DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) - uses multiple devices at different locations to targer a network / server 
                Zombie attacks
            
           3 Network Level Attacks: 
             - SYN Flood attack - simulates a TCP connection and floods server with SYN packets 
             - ICMP Flood attack - repeatedly sends ICMP packets to a network server 
             - Ping of Death attack - sends oversized ICMP packet larger than 64KB

        <b>02) Reading 'tcpdump logs'</b>
                Packet Sniffers (Packet Analyzer) = tool that captures and analyzes data traffic inside a network - investigate suspicious activity
                  common Network Protcol Analyzers: \

                     - ManageEngine OpManager
                     - Azure Network Watcher
                     - Wireshark
                     - tcpdump -- this course will use tcpdump
                
                tcpdump - command line network analyzer. popular and lightweight
                  provides brief packet analysis and formats it to be easily read by humans. 
                    displays Source IP address, Destination IP address, as well as port #s used in communication     

               Information Contained in 'tcpdump' packet capture:
                - Timestamp: begins with timestamp formatted as HH:MM:SS.SSSS 
                - Source IP: packet's origin IP
                - Source Port: port where packet originated
                - Destination IP: address where packet is being transmitted
                - Destination Port: port # being transmitted to  
                
            Used to capture and view network communications and collect statistics
             - used to establish a baseline for network traffic patterns and utilization metrics
             - detect and identify malicious traffic
             - create customized alerts to send notifications when network security threats arrive 
             - locate unauthorized messaging, traffic, or wireless access points

        <b>03) Activity: Analayze Network Layer Communication</b> 
        Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.
            You are a cybersecurity analyst working at a company that specializes in providing IT consultant services. Several customers contacted your company to report that they were not able to access the company website www.yummyrecipesforme.com, and saw the error “destination port unreachable” after waiting for the page to load. 
              You are tasked with analyzing the situation and determining which network protocol was affected during this incident. To start, you visit the website and you also receive the error “destination port unreachable.” Next, you load your network analyzer tool, tcpdump, and load the webpage again. This time, you receive a lot of packets in your network analyzer. The analyzer shows that when you send UDP packets and receive an ICMP response returned to your host, the results contain an error message: “udp port 53 unreachable.” 
        
        In the DNS and ICMP log, you find the following information:
        
            1) In the first two lines of the log file, you see the initial outgoing request from your computer to the DNS server requesting the IP address of yummyrecipesforme.com. This request is sent in a UDP packet.
        
            2) Next you find timestamps that indicate when the event happened. In the log, this is the first sequence of numbers displayed. For example: 13:24:32.192571. This displays the time 1:24 p.m., 32.192571 seconds.
        
            3) The source and destination IP address is next. In the error log, this information is displayed as: 192.51.100.15.52444 > 203.0.113.2.domain. The IP address to the left of the greater than (>) symbol is the source address. In this example, the source is your computer’s IP address. The IP address to the right of the greater than (>) symbol is the destination IP address. In this case, it is the IP address for the DNS server: 203.0.113.2.domain
        
            4) The second and third lines of the log show the response to your initial ICMP request packet. In this case, the ICMP 203.0.113.2 line is the start of the error message indicating that the ICMP packet was undeliverable to the port of the DNS server.
        
            5) Next are the protocol and port number, which displays which protocol was used to handle communications and which port it was delivered to. In the error log, this appears as: udp port 53 unreachable. This means that the UDP protocol was used to request a domain name resolution using the address of the DNS server over port 53. Port 53, which aligns to the .domain extension in 203.0.113.2.domain, is a well-known port for DNS service. The word “unreachable” in the message indicates the message did not go through to the DNS server. Your browser was not able to obtain the IP address for yummyrecipesforme.com, which it needs to access the website because no service was listening on the receiving DNS port as indicated by the ICMP error message “udp port 53 unreachable.”
        
            6) The remaining lines in the log indicate that ICMP packets were sent two more times, but the same delivery error was received both times. 
        
        Now that you have captured data packets using a network analyzer tool, it is your job to identify which network protocol and service were impacted by this incident. Then, you will need to write a follow-up report. 
        
        As an analyst, you can inspect network traffic and network data to determine what is causing network-related issues during cybersecurity incidents. Later in this course, you will demonstrate how to manage and resolve incidents. For now, you only need to analyze the situation. 
        
        This incident, in the meantime, is being handled by security engineers after you and other analysts have reported the issue to your direct supervisor.

<h2>03.11 Network Attack Tactics and Defense</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Malicious Packet Sniffing</b>
                using software tools to observe data as it moves across a network
              Passive Packet Sniffing: data packets are read in transit
              Active Packet Sniffing: data packets are manipulated in transit  

              using a VPN can protect against malicious packet sniffing
              use HTTPS web addresses (with SSL/TLS encrytpion)
              avoid using unprotected wi-fi

        <b>02) IP Spoofing</b>
              attacker changes the source IP of a data packet to impersonate an authorized system and gain access
                ex: on-path attack - attacker places themselves in middle of authorized connection and intercepts or alters data in transit
                    replay attack - intercepts a data packet in transit and delays it or repeats it, at another time 
                    smurf attack - DDoS + IP Spoofing attack - sniffs user IP address and floods it with packets

               to prevent - encrypt data sent across network
                          - configure firewall so that it rejects traffic coming from outside the network that has the same IP address of the local network

<h2>03.13 Introduction to Security Hardening</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Welcome to wk 04</b>
                harden on devices
                          networks 
                          applications
                          Cloud infrastructure

            patch and backup the system             

        <b>02) Security Hardening</b>
                Security Hardening: process of strengthening a system to reduce vulnerability and attack surface
                    Attack Surface: all potential vulnerabilities used to attack the system
                 
                 regular maintenance helps keep the system running optimally, software updates, device and software configuration changes    
                
                 hardening is conducted on - Hardware, Operating Systems, Applications, Computer Networks, Databases

                 physical security (gates, security guards, swipe badges) are all part of physical security hardening

                - keeping data encrypted
                - removing unused data and applications
                - disabling unused ports
                - limiting access and permissions

                hardening helps system run more efficiently and reduces the overall attack surface 

                conduct regular penetration testing a pen test is a simulated attack that helps identify in a system, network, website, application, or process
                  pen testers document findings in a report - security teams then determine the type of vulnerabilities and come up with a plan to fix them
    </pre>
<h2>03.14 OS Hardening</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) OS hardening Practices</b>
         OS = interface between user and hardware of computer system

         update the system, backup the system regularly, keep up to date list of users and devices
          - ensure encryption is enabled for the system (only have to do that once)

         Patch update = software update that addresses security and vulnerability issues within the program  

         Baseline Configuration (Baseline Image): documented set of specifications within a system that is used as basis of future builds, releases, and updates

         set strong password, password length, password expiration

         MFA (Multi-factor Authentication): something you know (password), something you have (physical card or key), something unique about you (biometric)
           
        <b>02) Brute Force Attacks and OS</b>
                Brute Force Attack = trial-and-error process of discovering private information.
                    Simple Brute Force attack: threat actor try to guess login credentials -- like they do in the movies where they enter usernames and passwords to unlock a computer 

                    Dictionary Attack = use list of commonly used paswords and stolen credentials from previous breaches to access the system

                 brute force attacks can be tedious and time consuming
            VMs (Virtual Machines) = software versions of physical computers. additional layer of security fo an organization because they can run code in an isolated environment. VMs are easily deleted and reinstalled with clean images or checkpoints
                 there are risks that a malicious risk on a VM can escape and access the host machine
                 
            Sandbox = testing environment that allows you to execute software or programs seperatly from your network
            
        Brute Force Prevention:
            Salting & hasingh - hashing converts info into unique value that can be used to determine its integrity - 1 way function. Salting adds random characters to the hashed password
            MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) or 2FA (2 factor auth) - requires user to verify identity in 2 or more ways; 2FA requires only 2 ways
            CAPTCHA & reCAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) - helps prevent software from brute force. reCAPTCHA is a free service from google
            Password Policies - Standardize good password practices - how complex password should be, how often the password is updated, limits to login attemts, etc... 

        <b>03) Activity: Apply OS Hardening Techniques</b>
        You are a cybersecurity analyst for yummyrecipesforme.com, a website that sells recipes and cookbooks. A disgruntled baker has decided to publish the website’s best-selling recipes for the public to access for free. 

        The baker executed a brute force attack to gain access to the web host. They repeatedly entered several known default passwords for the administrative account until they correctly guessed the right one. After they obtained the login credentials, they were able to access the admin panel and change the website’s source code. They embedded a javascript function in the source code that prompted visitors to download and run a file upon visiting the website. After running the downloaded file, the customers are redirected to a fake version of the website where the seller’s recipes are now available for free.
        
        Several hours after the attack, multiple customers emailed yummyrecipesforme’s helpdesk. They complained that the company’s website had prompted them to download a file to update their browsers. The customers claimed that, after running the file, the address of the website changed and their personal computers began running more slowly. 
        
        In response to this incident, the website owner tries to log in to the admin panel but is unable to, so they reach out to the website hosting provider. You and other cybersecurity analysts are tasked with investigating this security event.
        
        To address the incident, you create a sandbox environment to observe the suspicious website behavior. You run the network protocol analyzer tcpdump, then type in the URL for the website, yummyrecipesforme.com. As soon as the website loads, you are prompted to download an executable file to update your browser. You accept the download and allow the file to run. You then observe that your browser redirects you to a different URL, greatrecipesforme.com, which is designed to look like the original site. However, the recipes your company sells are now posted for free on the new website.  
        
        The logs show the following process:
           1. The browser requests a DNS resolution of the yummyrecipesforme.com URL.
           2. The DNS replies with the correct IP address. 
           3. The browser initiates an HTTP request for the webpage.
           4. The browser initiates the download of the malware.
           5. The browser requests another DNS resolution for greatrecipesforme.com.
           6. The DNS server responds with the new IP address.
           7. The browser initiates an HTTP request to the new IP address.
        
        A senior analyst confirms that the website was compromised. The analyst checks the source code for the website. They notice that javascript code had been added to prompt website visitors to download an executable file. Analysis of the downloaded file found a script that redirects the visitors’ browsers from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com. 
        
        The cybersecurity team reports that the web server was impacted by a brute force attack. The disgruntled baker was able to guess the password easily because the admin password was still set to the default password. Additionally, there were no controls in place to prevent a brute force attack. 
        
        Your job is to document the incident in detail, including identifying the network protocols used to establish the connection between the user and the website.  You should also recommend a security action to take to prevent brute force attacks in the future.

<h2>03.15 Network Hardening</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Network Hardening Practices</b>
            - Firewall Rules Maintenance    
            - Network Log Analysis - analyzing network logs to identify events of interest
            - Patch Updates
            - Server Backups

            SIEM tools are used in Network Log Analysis

            1 time tasks: 
            - Port Filtering - blocks or limits certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication
            - Network Access Privilege 
            - Encryption over Networks

           Network Segmentation is part of network hardening  

           encrypt data and restricted data should be encrypted to a higher standard

        <b>02) Network Security Applications</b>
                Firewall - allow or block traffic based on a set of rules -- inspects port information on data packet 
                              OSI level 3 filters IP addresses
                              OSI level 4 filters by Port number
                              OSI level 7 filters by Protocols state 
                IDS (Intrusion Detection System) - monitors system activity and alerts of possible intrusion - scan for known attacks and anomalies, placed behing the firewall, but before the LAN
                IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) - proactively takes action to stop the intrusion, not simply report it; also sits behind firewall in Network architecture
                SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) - software application 
                          Chronicle & Splunk are 2 major SIEM, open-source S

        <b>03) Activity: Analysis of Network Hardening</b>
        You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 

        After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:
               1. The organization’s employees' share passwords.
               2. The admin password for the database is set to the default.
               3. The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
               4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 
        
        If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 
        
        In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network.
