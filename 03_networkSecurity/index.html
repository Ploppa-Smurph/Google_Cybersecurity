        <b>03) What are Networks?</b>
                  a network is a group of connected devices
                    home network = printer, laptop, desktop, smart tv, etc...
                    office network = workstations, printer, servers, etc... 
                IP address: 
                MAC address: 
                LAN (Local Area Network): spans small area, house, office, school, etc...
                WAN (Wide Area Network): much larger area, city, state, country -=- the Internet is the largest WAN 
        
        <b>04) Working in Network Security</b>
                  keep network systems safe and resilient  
            always keep learning -- team sport

        <b>05) Useful Skills for Network Security</b>
                simulate advesaries and threats
                  - programming
                  - operational and platform security 
                  - command line = allows you to interact with low levels of the operating system like memory and higher level like applications
                  - log parsing = helps in debugging and finding root issues
                  - network traffic analysis = looking across network and application layers to see what traffic is doing
                      -Could passwords be getting leaked? 
                      -Is the infrastructure secure?
                      -Are firewalls being readily configured securely?
        
        <b>06) Network Tools</b>
                Hub: broadcasts to ALL devices
                Switch: broadcasts to specific device or devices, more intelligent than a hub. only passes data to intended device
                Router: connects multiple networks together
                Modem: connects router to the internet, brings internet to the LAN
                Virtualization Tools: software that perform network operations, offered by cloud service providers 

        <b>07) Network Components, Devices, and Diagrams</b>
            <img src="../networkDevices.png" alt="network device layout" />
              
            MAC Address - unique to each device. first half of address = manufacturer information
            IP Address - assigned to device, most dynamic now - servers often have assigned IP addresses
            Firewalls - network security device that monitors traffic. Can restrict specific incoming and outgoing network traffic. often reside between secured internal network and untrusted outside sources (ie: the internet)
            Servers - provide services (web hosting, email, DNS Server, File Server, etc..) part of the Client-Server Model
            Hubs - direct traffic to ALL, not as secure as Switch
            Switch - directs network traffic, more secure than Hub because it directs traffic to intended destination ONLY
            Modems - Interface to ISP - send and receive traffic form the internet and translates into digital signals that devices on the network can understand.
            Wireless Access Point - uses radio waves for wireless communication.
                Wi-Fi: set of standards used by network devices to communicate wirelessly
            Network Diagrams - topographical map that shows devices on the network and how they connect. 

        <b>08) Design a Local Area Network</b>
        
        <b>09) Cloud Networks</b>
                    not locally hosted
                        can reduce cost by being more flexible
                Cloud Computing = using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of local physical devices
                 Cloud Network = collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote data centers that can be accessed via the internet
                    Cloud providers offer:
                        - on-demand storage
                        - processing power as needed
                        - analytics for monitoring web traffic         
        
        <b>10) Cloud Computing and Software-defined Networks</b>
                    - Software as a service (SaaS) refers to software suites operated by the CSP that a company can use remotely without hosting the software. 
                    - Infrastructure as a service (Iaas) refers to the use of virtual computer components offered by the CSP. These include virtual containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web console. Cloud-compute and storage services can be used to operate existing applications and other technology workloads without significant modifications. Existing applications can be modified to take advantage of the availability, performance, and security features that are unique to cloud provider services.
                    - Platform as a service (PaaS) refers to tools that application developers can use to design custom applications for their company. Custom applications are designed and accessed in the cloud and used for a company’s specific business needs.
                Hybrid environment - both Cloud and On-site networks are utilized
                Software Defined Networks (SDNs) - made of virtual network devices and services, virtual switches, routers, and firewalls 

                What are the benefits of cloud computing and virtual networking?
                      Reliability: more available to more people across the globe with minimal interruption
                      Cost: costs less than having to buy all the hardware to build data centers
                      Scalability: can easily add or remove features as needed extremely quickly and easily

<h2>03.03 Network Communication</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Introduction to Network Communication</b>
                  Communication - sending data packets from one point to another
                  Data Packets - have information about sender, receiver, and content of message
                   Header - contains IP address and MAC address of destination device, also contains "Protocol Number" that tells receiving device what to do with the information
                   Body - contains data that needs to be transmitted during communication
                   Footer - tells the receiving device that the communication is complete
                
                Network Performance is measured by 'Bandwidth'
                 Bandwidth = amount of data a device receives every second 
                
                Packet Sniffing - practice of capturing and inspecting data packets sent across the network

        <b>02) TCP/IP Model</b>
                Transmission Control Protocol - internet communication protocol that allows 2 devices to connect and stream data 
                Internet Protocol - set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on the internet
                Port - software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network
                    Port 25 - email communication
                    Port 443 - Secure Internet communication (HTTPS)
                    Port 20 - Large File Transfers
                
        <b>03) 4 layers of TCP/IP</b>
                TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across the network
                   1. Network Access Layer - deals with the creation of data packets and their transmission across the network
                            - includes hardware devices                   
                   2. Internet Layer - where IP address is attactched to indicate location of sender and receiver. 
                            - focus on how networks communicate - handles LAN communication or sending out to WAN
                   3. Transport Layer - controls flow of traffic across the network. permit or deny communications with other devices and includes connection status information
                            - error control / handling
                   4. Application Layer - protocols determine how data packets will interact with the receiving device
                            - functions organized at application layer include file transfers and email services
        
        <b>04) Learn More about TCP/IP</b>
                1 - Network Access Layer = Ethernet vs Wireless (and more)
                2 - Internet Layer = IP (v4, v6)
                3 - Transport Layer = TCP v UDP (and more)
                4 - Application Layer = HTTP, TLS, DNS, etc... 

                Network Access Layer (aka Data Link Layer) - hubs, modems, cables and wiring are part of this layer
                        - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is part of the Network Access Layer
                           ARP assists IP with directing data packets on the same physical network by mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses.
                Internet Layer (aka Network Layer) - responsible for ensuirng delivery to destination. 
                        - IP (Internet Protocol) - sends data packets to the correct destination. IP packets allow communication between two networks
                        - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) - shares information and status updates of data packets. useful for detecting and troubleshooting network errors.
                                ICMP reports information about packets that were dropped 
                Transport Layer - responsible for transmitting data to destination.
                        - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - ensures data is reliably transmitted to the destination
                        - User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - not concerned with reliability of transmission - performance sensitive applications like video streaming
                Application Layer - similar to Application, Presentation, and Session layers of OSI model. responsible for making network requests and responding to requests. 
                    defines which internet services and applications users can access. 
                         - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
                         - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
                         - Secure Shell (SSH)
                         - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
                         - Domain Name System (DNS)
                TCP/IP combines multiple OSI model layers into each layer (TCP/IP has 4 layers, OSI has 7 Layers)                               

        <b>05) the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model</b>
                the TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across networks.

            the OSI model is a standerdized concept that describes the 7 layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network
                1. Physical Layer - corresponds to physical hardware. Hubs, Modems, Cables and Wiring 
                2. Data Link Layer - sending and receiving data packets within a single network - Switches and NIC (Network Interface Cards) on LANs
                3. Network Layer - oversees receiving frames from data link (layer 2) and deliving to intended destination
                        ex: Data Packets allow communication between 2 networks.
                4. Transport Layer - responsible for delivering data between devices. handles data transfer, flow and breaking data down to smaller data packets
                        ex: TCP and UPD are transport layer protocols
                5. Session Layer - describes when connection is established between 2 devices.  
                        ex: authentication, reconnection, setting checkpoints of data transfer
                6. Presentation Layer - Data translation and encryption for the network, processes at the presentation layer require a standardized format.
                        ex: encryption, compression, etc... take place. 1 example of encryption takes place at this layer is SSL to encrypt data for HTTPS
                7. Application Layer - processes directly involving everyday users; <i>'user connection to the network via applications and request'</i>
                        ex: browsers utilize HTTP / HTTPS and also DNS to translate web domain names to IP addresses; email uses SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send and receive email
