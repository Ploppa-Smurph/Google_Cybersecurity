        <b>03) What are Networks?</b>
                  a network is a group of connected devices
                    home network = printer, laptop, desktop, smart tv, etc...
                    office network = workstations, printer, servers, etc... 
                IP address: 
                MAC address: 
                LAN (Local Area Network): spans small area, house, office, school, etc...
                WAN (Wide Area Network): much larger area, city, state, country -=- the Internet is the largest WAN 
        
        <b>04) Working in Network Security</b>
                  keep network systems safe and resilient  
            always keep learning -- team sport

        <b>05) Useful Skills for Network Security</b>
                simulate advesaries and threats
                  - programming
                  - operational and platform security 
                  - command line = allows you to interact with low levels of the operating system like memory and higher level like applications
                  - log parsing = helps in debugging and finding root issues
                  - network traffic analysis = looking across network and application layers to see what traffic is doing
                      -Could passwords be getting leaked? 
                      -Is the infrastructure secure?
                      -Are firewalls being readily configured securely?
        
        <b>06) Network Tools</b>
                Hub: broadcasts to ALL devices
                Switch: broadcasts to specific device or devices, more intelligent than a hub. only passes data to intended device
                Router: connects multiple networks together
                Modem: connects router to the internet, brings internet to the LAN
                Virtualization Tools: software that perform network operations, offered by cloud service providers 

        <b>07) Network Components, Devices, and Diagrams</b>
            <img src="../networkDevices.png" alt="network device layout" />
              
            MAC Address - unique to each device. first half of address = manufacturer information
            IP Address - assigned to device, most dynamic now - servers often have assigned IP addresses
            Firewalls - network security device that monitors traffic. Can restrict specific incoming and outgoing network traffic. often reside between secured internal network and untrusted outside sources (ie: the internet)
            Servers - provide services (web hosting, email, DNS Server, File Server, etc..) part of the Client-Server Model
            Hubs - direct traffic to ALL, not as secure as Switch
            Switch - directs network traffic, more secure than Hub because it directs traffic to intended destination ONLY
            Modems - Interface to ISP - send and receive traffic form the internet and translates into digital signals that devices on the network can understand.
            Wireless Access Point - uses radio waves for wireless communication.
                Wi-Fi: set of standards used by network devices to communicate wirelessly
            Network Diagrams - topographical map that shows devices on the network and how they connect. 

        <b>08) Design a Local Area Network</b>
        
        <b>09) Cloud Networks</b>
                    not locally hosted
                        can reduce cost by being more flexible
                Cloud Computing = using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of local physical devices
                 Cloud Network = collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote data centers that can be accessed via the internet
                    Cloud providers offer:
                        - on-demand storage
                        - processing power as needed
                        - analytics for monitoring web traffic         
        
        <b>10) Cloud Computing and Software-defined Networks</b>
                    - Software as a service (SaaS) refers to software suites operated by the CSP that a company can use remotely without hosting the software. 
                    - Infrastructure as a service (Iaas) refers to the use of virtual computer components offered by the CSP. These include virtual containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web console. Cloud-compute and storage services can be used to operate existing applications and other technology workloads without significant modifications. Existing applications can be modified to take advantage of the availability, performance, and security features that are unique to cloud provider services.
                    - Platform as a service (PaaS) refers to tools that application developers can use to design custom applications for their company. Custom applications are designed and accessed in the cloud and used for a company’s specific business needs.
                Hybrid environment - both Cloud and On-site networks are utilized
                Software Defined Networks (SDNs) - made of virtual network devices and services, virtual switches, routers, and firewalls 

                What are the benefits of cloud computing and virtual networking?
                      Reliability: more available to more people across the globe with minimal interruption
                      Cost: costs less than having to buy all the hardware to build data centers
                      Scalability: can easily add or remove features as needed extremely quickly and easily

<h2>03.03 Network Communication</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Introduction to Network Communication</b>
                  Communication - sending data packets from one point to another
                  Data Packets - have information about sender, receiver, and content of message
                   Header - contains IP address and MAC address of destination device, also contains "Protocol Number" that tells receiving device what to do with the information
                   Body - contains data that needs to be transmitted during communication
                   Footer - tells the receiving device that the communication is complete
                
                Network Performance is measured by 'Bandwidth'
                 Bandwidth = amount of data a device receives every second 
                
                Packet Sniffing - practice of capturing and inspecting data packets sent across the network

        <b>02) TCP/IP Model</b>
                Transmission Control Protocol - internet communication protocol that allows 2 devices to connect and stream data 
                Internet Protocol - set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on the internet
                Port - software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network
                    Port 25 - email communication
                    Port 443 - Secure Internet communication (HTTPS)
                    Port 20 - Large File Transfers
                
        <b>03) 4 layers of TCP/IP</b>
                TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across the network
                   1. Network Access Layer - deals with the creation of data packets and their transmission across the network
                            - includes hardware devices                   
                   2. Internet Layer - where IP address is attactched to indicate location of sender and receiver. 
                            - focus on how networks communicate - handles LAN communication or sending out to WAN
                   3. Transport Layer - controls flow of traffic across the network. permit or deny communications with other devices and includes connection status information
                            - error control / handling
                   4. Application Layer - protocols determine how data packets will interact with the receiving device
                            - functions organized at application layer include file transfers and email services
        
        <b>04) Learn More about TCP/IP</b>
                1 - Network Access Layer = Ethernet vs Wireless (and more)
                2 - Internet Layer = IP (v4, v6)
                3 - Transport Layer = TCP v UDP (and more)
                4 - Application Layer = HTTP, TLS, DNS, etc... 

                Network Access Layer (aka Data Link Layer) - hubs, modems, cables and wiring are part of this layer
                        - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is part of the Network Access Layer
                           ARP assists IP with directing data packets on the same physical network by mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses.
                Internet Layer (aka Network Layer) - responsible for ensuirng delivery to destination. 
                        - IP (Internet Protocol) - sends data packets to the correct destination. IP packets allow communication between two networks
                        - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) - shares information and status updates of data packets. useful for detecting and troubleshooting network errors.
                                ICMP reports information about packets that were dropped 
                Transport Layer - responsible for transmitting data to destination.
                        - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - ensures data is reliably transmitted to the destination
                        - User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - not concerned with reliability of transmission - performance sensitive applications like video streaming
                Application Layer - similar to Application, Presentation, and Session layers of OSI model. responsible for making network requests and responding to requests. 
                    defines which internet services and applications users can access. 
                         - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
                         - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
                         - Secure Shell (SSH)
                         - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
                         - Domain Name System (DNS)
                TCP/IP combines multiple OSI model layers into each layer (TCP/IP has 4 layers, OSI has 7 Layers)                               

        <b>05) the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model</b>
                the TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across networks.

            the OSI model is a standerdized concept that describes the 7 layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network
                1. Physical Layer - corresponds to physical hardware. Hubs, Modems, Cables and Wiring 
                2. Data Link Layer - sending and receiving data packets within a single network - Switches and NIC (Network Interface Cards) on LANs
                3. Network Layer - oversees receiving frames from data link (layer 2) and deliving to intended destination
                        ex: Data Packets allow communication between 2 networks.
                4. Transport Layer - responsible for delivering data between devices. handles data transfer, flow and breaking data down to smaller data packets
                        ex: TCP and UPD are transport layer protocols
                5. Session Layer - describes when connection is established between 2 devices.  
                        ex: authentication, reconnection, setting checkpoints of data transfer
                6. Presentation Layer - Data translation and encryption for the network, processes at the presentation layer require a standardized format.
                        ex: encryption, compression, etc... take place. 1 example of encryption takes place at this layer is SSL to encrypt data for HTTPS
                7. Application Layer - processes directly involving everyday users; <i>'user connection to the network via applications and request'</i>
                        ex: browsers utilize HTTP / HTTPS and also DNS to translate web domain names to IP addresses; email uses SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send and receive email

<h2>03.04 Local and Wide Network Communication</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) IP Addresses and Network Communication</b>
               unique sting of characters that identifies a device on the network 
             IPv4 = 192.10.0.15 - 4 sets = total of 4 bytes of address info
             IPv6 = 684D:1111:222:3333:4444:5555:6:77 - 32 characters = total of 16 bytes of address info

             Public address = assigned by ISP, outward facing IP address
             Private address = only seen by devices on the same local network

             MAC address = alphanumeric identifier assigned to each physical device. 
                    switches map MAC address to devices on network and creates MAC Address Table
                    
        <b>02) Components for Network Layer Communications</b>
                IPv6 data packet header is simpler than IPv4 
                    13 parts of IPv4 header:
                        Version: The first 4-bit header tells receiving devices what protocol the packet is using. The packet used in the illustration above is an IPv4 packet.
                        IP Header Length (HLEN): HLEN is the packet’s header length. This value indicates where the packet header ends and the data segment begins. 
                        Type of Service (ToS): Routers prioritize packets for delivery to maintain quality of service on the network. The ToS field provides the router with this information.
                        Total Length: This field communicates the total length of the entire IP packet, including the header and data. The maximum size of an IPv4 packet is 65,535 bytes.
                        Identification: For IPv4 packets that are larger than 65, 535 bytes, the packets are divided, or fragmented, into smaller IP packets. The identification field provides a unique identifier for all the fragments of the original IP packet so that they can be reassembled once they reach their destination.                     
                        Flags: This field provides the routing device with more information about whether the original packet has been fragmented and if there are more fragments in transit.
                        Fragmentation Offset: The fragment offset field tells routing devices where in the original packet the fragment belongs.
                        Time to Live (TTL): TTL prevents data packets from being forwarded by routers indefinitely. It contains a counter that is set by the source. The counter is decremented by one as it passes through each router along its path. When the TTL counter reaches zero, the router currently holding the packet will discard the packet and return an ICMP Time Exceeded error message to the sender. 
                        Protocol: The protocol field tells the receiving device which protocol will be used for the data portion of the packet.
                        Header Checksum: The header checksum field contains a checksum that can be used to detect corruption of the IP header in transit. Corrupted packets are discarded.
                        Source IP Address: The source IP address is the IPv4 address of the sending device.
                        Destination IP Address: The destination IP address is the IPv4 address of the destination device.
                        Options: The options field allows for security options to be applied to the packet if the HLEN value is greater than five. The field communicates these options to the routing devices.

<h2>03.06 Introduction to Network Protocols</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Welcome to wk 02</b>
                -Network Protocols
                -VPNs (Virtual Private Network)
                -Firewalls, Security Zones, and Proxy Servers

        <b>02) Network Protocols</b>
                <i>Network Protocols are a set of rules used by 2 or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and structure of data</i>   
                ex: a) when accessing a website, your device first uses TCP to establish a connection to the web server.
                     -TCP allows 2 devices to connect and stream data, TCP also verifies both devices (handshake)
                    b) the connection is established after the web server responds and sends data packets. the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) helps get the data to the correct MAC address
                    c) now we can access the website, HTTPS allows webbrowsers to more securely send and receive data across the internet
                      -HTTPS uses SSL/TLS for a Secure Socket Layer and Transport Layer Security to encrypt data and send securely across the internet
                    d) DNS or Domain Name Server translates the IP address to a web address

        <b>03) Common Network Protocols</b>
                <b>Communication Protocols</b>
                    - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): allows 2 devices to connect. (happens at Transport Layer of TCP/IP model)
                        3 way handshake = device sends SYN request -> server responds with SYN/ACK to acknowledge -> then TCP connection is established 
                    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol): connectionless protocol, less reliable than TCP. UPD happens at Transport Layer
                    - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Application Layer Protocol - uses Port 80. communicate between browser and server
                    - DNS (Domain Name Server): translates IP address into domain name. DNS occurs at Application layer -- uses UDP & port 53 (default)
                <b>Management Protocols</b>
                    - SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol): monitor and manage devices on internet - SNMP occurs at Application Layer
                    - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): used to troubleshoot network connectivity isses, ICMP occurs at Internet Layer
                <b>Security Protocols</b>
                    - HTTPS (Hypertext Protocol Secure): Port 443; Application Layer.
                    - SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol): TCP port 22 (SSH); SFTP uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standar). SFTP occurs at Application Layer 

        <b>04) Additional Network Protocols</b>
                IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority):
                    Private IP Ranges:

        <b>06) Wireless Protocols</b>
                 IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards
                    WPA, WPA2, WPA3 -- security measures in wi-fi

        <b>07) Evolution of Wireless Protocols</b>
                 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
               802.11 deal with Wi-Fi specifly 
               
               WEP (Wireless Equivalent Privacy) - old - change it!!
               WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) - improves on WEP. uses TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)
                        threat actors can use KRACK attack (Keygen Reinstallation Attack) to decrypt transmissions - set new key to all 0s and the transmission is as-if unencrypted
               WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2.0) - uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and TKIP - uses CCMP, still vulnerable to KRACK attack
                    Personal - easy to implement
                    Enterprise - more complicated setup with higher security for wireless transmission
               WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3.0) - address KRACK vulnerabilty, SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals), offers 128-bit encryption & 192-bit encryption for enterprise

        <b>01) Firewalls and Network Security Measures</b>
                <i>Firewall is a network security device that monitors traffic to and from your network</i>
                Port Filtering: blocking or allowing certain ports to limit unwanted communication
                Stateful: keeps track of information passing through it and proactively filters threats
                Stateless: operate on predefined rules, does not keep track of data packets 

                Hardware: most basic, a physical piece of hardware
                Software: software used like a physical firewall, does require some processing power since it is software
                Cloud: FaaS - Firewall as a Service - protects onsite computers and cloud held data 

                NGFW (Next Gen Firewall): more secure that stateful, has deep packet inspection and Intrusion Detection 
                Proxy server: 

        <b>02) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</b>
                 changes Public IP address to hide location so as to keep data private when using a public network (ie: the internet)
                <i>Encapsulation</i> - wrapping data packet inside other data packets to protect sensitive data

        <b>03) Security Zones</b>
                segment of the network that protects the internal network from the internet
                Network Segmentation: security technique that divides network into segments each with their own access permissions and security rules
                  ex: guest wi-fi at coffee shop or hotel, there is a seperate password protected connection for business operations 
                Subnets - maintains privacy for different departments in a domain  

                Uncontolled Security Zone: all networks outside of an organization's control
                Controlled Security Zone: area to protect the internal network
                   DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): Contains Web-servers, Proxy servers, DNS servers, E-mail, File Servers for external communication
                   Internal Network: Private data the organization needs to protect
                   Restricted Zone: only accessible to certain employees in the internal network, more secure
                should have DMZ between 2 firewalls - 1st filters traffic outside DMZ, 2nd filters traffic moving into internal network 
                    there would be an additional firewall between the internal network and restricted zone

        <b>04) Subnetting and CIDR</b>
                Subnetting = creates smaller networks inside a network. can be used to create security zones.  
                CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation for Subnetting 
                  ex: 198.51.100.0/24 will encompass all IP addresses 198.51.100.0 - 198.51.100.255

              <a href="https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr">CIDR to IPv4 conversion tool</a>    

        <b>05) Proxy Servers</b>
                secures Internal network
              Proxy Server = server that fulfills requests of clients by forwarding them to another server  
               proxy servers also cache external data and save time on repetative calls
              Forward Proxy Server = regulates and restricts access to the internet - GOAL: hide IP address and approve outgoing request
              Reverse Proxy Server = regulates internet's access to internal server - GOAL: accept incoming traffic, approve it and forward to the internal servers
              E-mail Proxy Server = filters spam by verifying senders address wasn't forged
                 ex:

<h2>03.09 Introduction to Network Intrusion</h2>
    <pre>
        <b>01) Welcome to wk 03</b>
                - Securing Networks
                - Network Intrusion Tactics
                - Protect against Network Attacks

        <b>02) the Case for Securing Networks</b>
                common network intrusions:
                  - Malware
                  - Spoofing
                  - Packet Sniffing
                  - Packet Flooding 
                hacks can hurt an organization by: 
                   - leaking valuable or confidential information
                   - damaging an organization's reputation
                   - impacting customer retention  
                   - can cost money and time
             ex: recent hack 2014 Home Depot was hacked and 56 million customers were affected      

        <b>03) How Intrusions Compromise Your System</b>
                Network Interception Attacks: packet sniffing - can alter messages, interupt network operations
                        malicious packet sniffing, on-path attack, and replay attack
                
                Backdoor Attacks: find an open way to install malware, perform DoS attack (DoS floods network / server with network traffic so it cannot respond)
                
                Impacts from intrusions: 
                 - Financial: normal operations could be affected causing loss of money
                 - Reputation: negative impact on how public views company 
                 - Public Safety: recent power grid and water system attacks are terrorism

        <b>01) Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks</b>
              <i>An attack that targets a network / server and floods it with network traffic</i>
              objective: interupt everyday operations by overloading system, causing crash or inabiltiy to handle legitimate request 
              DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) - uses multiple devices at different locations to targer a network / server 
                Zombie attacks
            
           3 Network Level Attacks: 
             - SYN Flood attack - simulates a TCP connection and floods server with SYN packets 
             - ICMP Flood attack - repeatedly sends ICMP packets to a network server 
             - Ping of Death attack - sends oversized ICMP packet larger than 64KB
