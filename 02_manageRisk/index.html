    <b>01) Welcome to Week 01</b>
            help with knowledge, skills and tools

    <b>02) Explore the CISSP Security Domains, Part 1</b>
           -Security Posture- organization's ability to manage defense of critical assets, and react to change

            01) Security and Risk Management: Define security goals and objectives; Risk mitigation; Compliance; Business continuity; Legal regulations
                    - Risk Mitigation: having procedures and controls in place to reduce impact of risk
                    - Compliance:
                    - Business Continuity: organization's ability to maintain everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans
            02) Asset Security: securing digital and physical assets. Relates to: storage, maintainance, retention, and destruction of data 
            03) Security Architecture and Engineering: optimize data security with tools, systems, and processes in place to protect assets and data
                    - Shared Responsibilty: ALL individuals within organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security
            04) Communication and Network Security: managing and securing physical networks and wireless communication

    <b>03) Explore the CISSP Security Domains, Part 2</b>
            05) Identity and Access Management (IAM): access and authorization to data should be secure & users MUST follow established policies to control and manage assets
                    - entry level analysts help make certain people have correct access and authorization -- 
                    4 componetns of IAM: Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Accountability
            06) Security Assessment and Testing: conducting security testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities 
            07) Security Operations: conducting investigations and implementing preventitive measures
            08) Software Development Security: using secure coding practices while developing applications
    
    <b>04) Security Domains Cybersecurity Analysts Need to Know</b>
            1) Security and Risk Management: - InfoSec is part of this domain
                    orginizations emplement training and use Playbooks (ex: change practices to adhere to new legal / regulation standards)
            2) Asset Security: Securely Storing, Maintaining, and Destruction of data and assets
            3) Security Architecture and Engineering: Create processes to ensure tools, systems and procedures are in place to secure assets
                    Shared Responsibilty, Concept of Least Privilege, Seperation of Duties, Zero Trust are all examples of this domain
            4) Communication and Network Security: Manages and Secures physical networking and wireless communication
            5) Identity and Access Management (IAM): Ensure identities and authentication of users to access data (Principle of Least Privilege)            
            6) Security Assessment and Testing: Identify and mitigate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Test, Analyze Data, and Audit.
            7) Security Operations: Investigation of potential breaches, Training. Respond to active attacks
            8) Software Development Security: Secure programming practices. Incorporate security in all aspects of 'Development Lifecycle'

<h2>02.03 Navigate Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilties</h2>
<pre>
    <b>01) Threats, Risks, Vulnerabilities</b>
                as Entry-Level Security Analyst required to handle digital assets
            -Threat: circumstance that can negatively impact assets (ex: social engineering exploit)
            -Risk: Anything that impacts confidentiality, integrity, or availability or an asset
                  Low Risk: information that will NOT harm organization's reputation or operations and will not cause financial damage
                  Medium Risk: information not available to the public that may cause some damage to reputation, finances, or ongoing operations
                  High Risk: information protected by regulations or laws that can severly impact finances, reputations, or everyday operations 
            -Vulnerability: a weakness that can be exploited by a threat

    <b>02) Key Impacts of Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities</b>
             Ransomware: malicious attack that encrypts information and demands payment to restore access
                  surface web: normal internet
                  deep web: organization's intranet (business network)
                  dark web: accessed by using special software
            Financial Impacts of attacks: interuption of everyday operations, payment of money for ransomware, fines for non-compliance of laws and regulations       
            Identity Theft due to attacks: it happens and then 'threat actors' can sell information on dark web
            Reputation loss due to attack: a hack looks bad, plus organizations may be sued or have to pay fines
