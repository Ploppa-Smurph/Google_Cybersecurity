<h2>02.03 Navigate Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilties</h2>
<pre>
    <b>01) Threats, Risks, Vulnerabilities</b>
                as Entry-Level Security Analyst required to handle digital assets
            -Threat: circumstance that can negatively impact assets (ex: social engineering exploit)
            -Risk: Anything that impacts confidentiality, integrity, or availability or an asset
                  Low Risk: information that will NOT harm organization's reputation or operations and will not cause financial damage
                  Medium Risk: information not available to the public that may cause some damage to reputation, finances, or ongoing operations
                  High Risk: information protected by regulations or laws that can severly impact finances, reputations, or everyday operations 
            -Vulnerability: a weakness that can be exploited by a threat

    <b>02) Key Impacts of Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities</b>
             Ransomware: malicious attack that encrypts information and demands payment to restore access
                  surface web: normal internet
                  deep web: organization's intranet (business network)
                  dark web: accessed by using special software
            Financial Impacts of attacks: interuption of everyday operations, payment of money for ransomware, fines for non-compliance of laws and regulations       
            Identity Theft due to attacks: it happens and then 'threat actors' can sell information on dark web
            Reputation loss due to attack: a hack looks bad, plus organizations may be sued or have to pay fines  

    <b>03) Manage, Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities</b>
            analyze risks and provide solutions 

    <b>04) NIST's Risk Management Framework</b>
            1) Prepare - manage security before a breach occurs
            2) Catagorize - develop risk management processes and tasks
            3) Select - choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization (ex: keeping all Playbooks up to date)
            4) Implement - put in place security and privacy plans for the organization
            5) Assess - determine if established controls are implemented correctly. find potential weakness and determine if tools should be updated
            6) Authorize - accountability for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization. (ex: generating reports)
            7) Monitor - being aware how systems are operating
    
    <b>05) Manage Common Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities</b>
               common ways for 'Risk Management': 
                        1) Acceptance: accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity
                        2) Avoidance: creating plans to avoid a risk altogether
                        3) Transference: transferring risk to a 3rd party to manage
                        4) Mitigation: lessening the impact of a known risk

            Threats:
                    - Insider Threats: staff or vendors abusing authority to access / obtain data that may harm the organization            
                    - Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): 'Threat Actor' maintains unauthorized access for an extended time

            Risks: 
                    - External Risk: outside an organization that can harm assets. (ex: Threat Actor trying to gain SPII)         
                    - Internal Risk: current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a risk
                    - Legacy Systems: old systems in the network that may pose threats
                    - Multiparty Risk: outsourcing of work to 3rd parties may expose organizational secrets.
                    - Software Compliance / Licensing: not keeping software update, patched, or not keeping licenses current
            
            Vulnerabilities:
                    - ProxyLogon: pre-authenticated vulnerabiltiy that affect Microsoft Exchange
                    - ZeroLogon: vulnerability in Microsoft Netlogon authentication protocol
                    - Log4Shell: allows attackers to run Java code on another computer to leak sensitive information - it enables a remote attacker that runs malicious code
                    - PetitPotam: affects Window New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) - allows a LAN based attacker to initiate an authentication request
                    - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: allow attackers to exploit organizations because the organizations are not monitoring traffic properly
                    - Server-side Request Forgery: manipulates a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources.         

            common responsibilties for entry-level Cybersecurity Analyst = vulnerability management. monitoring systems and mitigating vulnerabilities.

<h2>02.05 More About Frameworks and Controls</h2>
<pre>
    <b>01) Welcome to wk 02</b>
            Cybersecurity help keep people safe, not only organizations

    <b>02) Frameworks</b> -- Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy
                physical and data assets need to be protected
                people are the biggest threat to security; employees can fall for phishing attacks, ex-employees can be disgruntled  
                        important to educate employees

    <b>03) Controls</b> -- address SPECIFIC risks (safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks)
                encryption: ensures confidentiality of sensitive data
                authentication: process of verifying who someone/something is
                authorization: concept of granting access to specific resources within a system 
                        authorization is permission to access different assets

    <b>04) Relationship Between Frameworks and Controls</b>
                Security Framework: Guidelines to adhere to standards and laws
                Security Control: Safeguards designed to reduce a specific risk (ex: using MFA multi-factor authentication to protect SPII)

           Physical Controls: gates, fences and locks; security guards; CCTV; access cards
           Technical Contorls: firewall, MFA multi-factor authentication, anti-virus software
           Administrative Controls: Seperation of duties; authorization; assest classification   
           
       Frameworks and Controls work together to create the Security Posture

    <b>01) Explore the CIA Triad</b>
                protect assets and data from threat actors
              CIA model helps inform organizations how to consider risks when setting up systems and security policies   
         Confidentiality: only authorized users can access specific assets (least privilege)
         Integrity: data is correct, authentic, and reliable
         Availability: data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it   

    <b>02) Use the CIA Triad to Protect Organizations</b>
    <b>03) Use the CIA Triad in Work Place Situations</b>

<h2>02.07 NIST Frameworks</h2>
<pre>
    <b>01) NIST Frameworks</b>
                National Institute of Standards and Technology
            - CSF (Cybersecurity Framework): voluntary framework consisting of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk 
                    - Identify
                    - Protect
                    - Detect
                    - Respond
                    - Recover
                ex: you get a high-risk notification that a workstation has been comprimised:
                       1st Identify which workstation -- you discover it has an unknown device plugged in
                       2nd Protect: you block the device from transmitting data to protect the organization from additional harm
                       3rd Detect: after removing the workstation from the network you use tools to detect and determine any additional behavior and learn more about the device 
                       4th Respond: you respond by investigating the incident who used the device? how did the threat occur? what was affected? where did the attack originate?      
                       5th Recover: try to recover files or data and correct any damage caused, get the workstation back up on the network
            - RMF (Risk Management Framework): 

    <b>02) Explore the 5 Functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework</b>
            - Identify: manage risks and their effect on organization's people and assets
                ex: you monitor and identify devices that can pose a risk on organization's network
            - Protect: implementing policies, procedures, training and tools to mitigate cybersecurity threats
                ex: study historical data and update policy and procedure to actively protect systems
            - Detect: finding security threats and improving monitoring capabilities to increase speed and efficiency of detections
                ex: 
            - Respond: using proper procedure to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents and implement improvements to the security process 
                ex: 
            - Recover: returning affected systems back to normal working state

<h2>02.08 OWASP Principles and Security Audits</h2>
<pre>
    <b>01) OWASP Security Principles</b>
            Open Web Application Security Project principles 
            1) Minimize the Attack Surface Area: reduce all potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited
                    attack vector examples: phishing emails and weak password
            2) Principle of Least Privilege: limiting access to assets
            3) Defense in Depth: have multiple controls to address each threat in different ways
                    ex: MFA, firewalls, intrusion detection system, permission settings -- all used together they help create multiple levels of defense  
            4) Seperation of Duties: not having privileges that you can abuse
                    ex: person that signs paychecks should not be the person preparing them
            5) Keep Security Simple: 
            6) Fix Security Issues Correctly:               
    <b>02) More About OWASP Security Principles</b>
                additonal OWASP security principles include:
            7) Establish Secure Defaults: the optimal secure state should be the default state
            8) Fail Securely: if something goes wrong have failsafes in place to prevent problems.
                 ex: if firewall fails it should close all open connections and prevent additional ones
            9) Don't Trust Services: when working with 3rd parties always double check security standards and information
            10) Avoid Security by Obscurity: instead of keeping code secret make certain an app is secure by:
                    including reasonable password policies, following 'defense in depth', business transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls

    <b>04) Plan a Security Audit</b>
            Security Audit = review of organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations
                2 types: external and internal security audits -- we are focusing on internal security audit
                    internal audits are normally conducted by a team, including an organization's compliance officer, security manager, and other security team members 
                            internal audits inform organization's security posture and to maintain compliance with changing laws and standards
                the purpose of internal security audits: Identify organizational risk, Assess controls, Correct Compliance issues        

            elements of audits: 
                1) Establishing the scope and goal of the audit
                        scope = the specific criteria of the security audit
                           scope identifies people, policies, procedures, assets, and technologies that might impact the security posture
                        goals = outline of security objectives or what needs to be achieved to improve security posture
                2) Conducting a Risk Assessment
                3) Completing a Controls Assessment
                4) Assessing Compliance
                5) Communicating Results to Stakeholders

    <b>05) Complete a Security Audit</b>
                discuss security audits part 02:
                  ask yourself: what is the audit meant to achieve? Which assets are most at risk?
                       are current controls sufficient? if not what compliance regulations need to be implemented? 
                3) Completing a Controls Assessment: 
                           administrative - human controls - password policies and additional procedure
                           technical - hardware and software used to protect assets (ie: intrusion detection and data encryption)
                           physical - prevent physical intrusion (ie: CCTV, Locks, Badges, Security Guards, etc) 
                4) Assessing Compliance: make certain that all regulatory standards are upheld
                5) Communicating Results to Stakeholders: sumarize scope and goals then list existing risks and note priority of risks. 
                                also must identify compliance regulations and provide any recommendations for improving organizations security posture

    <b>06) More About Security Audits</b>
            1) Identify the scope of the audit
                The audit should:
                    -List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.) 
                    -Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals
                    -Indicate how often an audit should be performed
                    -Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees
        
            2) Complete a risk assessment
                A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).
    
            3) Conduct the audit
                When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.
    
            4) Create a mitigation plan
                A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture. 
    
            5) Communicate results to stakeholders
                The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to. 

    <b>07) Portfolio Activity: Conduct Security Audit pt 01</b>
            <i>'Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

                The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   
                
                The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department. 
                
                Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment. Then, perform an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist. '</i>

<h2>02.10 Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Dashboards</h2>
<pre>
    <b>01) Welcome to wk 03</b>
            -collecting security data
            -detecting and analyzing threats
            -automating tasks

    <b>02) Logs and SIEM Tools</b>
              analyze log data to mitigate risks and threats
                   Log = record of events that occur withing organization's system and networks
                3 common log sources include: 
                   - Firewall logs: record of connections (attempted or established) - includes inbound and outbound traffic 
                   - Network logs: record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. records connections between devices
                   - Server logs: includes login, password, and username requests -- log of events related to services (such as websites and emails)   
                SIEM Tool - collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization
                    SIEM tools minimize the log data users have to analyze, therefore they increase efficiency and save time.

    <b>03) SIEM Dashboard</b>
                SIEM Dashboard - presents data in a format that is easy to understand
                   ex: use SIEM Dashboard to analyze login attempts, location or attempts, timeline of events
                 Metrics: key technical attributes (ex: response time, availability, and failure rate)  

    <b>04) Future of SIEM Tools</b>
            Cloud Hosted SIEM Tools
            Cloud Native SIEM Tools - take advantage of cloud capabilities: availability, flexibility, and scalability 

            SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) 

    <b>05) Parallels of Accessibility and Security</b>
                accessibility - making information, activities usable to as many people as possible
                  -- color red as a warning is ineffective for someone that is colorblind
