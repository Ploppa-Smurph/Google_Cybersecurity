    <b>03) My Path to Cybersecurity</b>
            Da'Queshia - time management, people skills, and communication are all important
              starts day with emails and then starts working on items in the 'bug queue', which is the list of bugs people have found in an app 
           uses attack trees and vectors everyday
           
    <b>04) Discussion Prompt: Connect with Classmates</b>
          <i>"I started learning cybersecurity to learn a new field and get into a different career. I have years of retail and service industry management experience and feel that I have gone as far as I can in these fields. The location where I live does not have very many job opportunities, so I wanted to study something that is currently in high demand.  I come into this course very curious and eager to learn. I believe everyday, in the security field, I will need to be both curious and eager to learn. The main reason I am taking this course is to get the Cybersecurity Certificate and, to also, reenforce the knowledge I am learning in another cybersecurity course. "</i>

<h2>05.02 Introduction to Assets</h2>
<pre>
    <b>01) Welcome to wk 01</b>
            smartphones, wearables, business automated processes --- enormous amounts of data are created each day
            security is a team effort - diverse teams see things from different points of view

            - Assest, Threat, and Vulnerability
            - Asset Inventories
            - Challenges in a rapidly changing digital world
            - Policies, Standards, and Procedures 
            - NIST Cybersecurity Framework

    <b>02) The What, Why, and How of Asset Security</b>
            Risk - anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset
                    CIA Triad = confidentiality, integrity, availability
            security risk planning is made based on 3 components: assets, threats, vulnerabilities
                - Asset - item perceived as having value to organization; can be physical or digital 
                - Threat - circumstance or event that can negatively affect assets; ex: a thief, bad storm, fire
                - Vulnerability - a weakness that can be exploited; ex: an unlocked door to a restricted area, hole in roof letting rain in 

    <b>03) Understand Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities</b>
            Security Risk = consider potential effects that negative event can have on business
             <b><i>Likelihood x Impact = Risk</i></b>
           used to prevent costly and disruptive events, identify improvments that can be made to systems and process, prioritize critical assets that require attention    


            Threats and Vulnerabilities are the 2 biggest Risk factors

            catagories of Threats: Intentional - ex: hacker gaining access to sensitive information by targeting a misconfigured setting
                                   Unintentional - ex: employee clicks on malicious link in email
                                   
            catagories of Vulnerabilities: Technical - ex: misconfigured software
                                           Human - ex: employee loses keycard in parking lot and allows entrance to facility                         

    <b>04) Life in Asset Security</b>
                starts with using SIEM - 
            problem solving 
               
    <b>05) Security Starts with Asset Classification</b>
            Asset Management - the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them
            Asset Inventory - catalog of assets that need to be protected
            Asset Classification - practice of labling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization

            Asset labeling: Public - shared with anyone
                            Internal Only - shared with anyone in the organization
                            Confidential - only accessed by those that need to work with the data
                            Restricted - need to know; highly sensitive and must be protected

    <b>06) Common Classification Requirements</b>
            Asset Management - tracking assets and the risks that affect them
                    identify, track, and classify assets

            Asset Classification - labeling asset based on sensitivity / importance to an organization
                    what you have
                    where it is
                    who owns it
                    how important it is  
             Public - no negative consequence if released
             Internal-Only - assets available to employees
             Confidential - assets whose disclosure may have negative impact to an organization 
             Restricted - reserved for incredibly sensitive assets, need-to-know information
            
            Challenges in classifying information - 
                
    <b>07) Activity: Classify the Assets Connected to a Home Network</b>
            One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.
        
            An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.
    
            A home office that includes a desktop computer, printer, router, webcam, speakers, headphones, and external hard drive.
    
            You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.
    
    
            To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:
               - Desktop or laptop computers
               - Smartphones
               - Smart home devices
               - Game consoles
               - Storage devices or servers
               - Video streaming devices
    
        Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.
