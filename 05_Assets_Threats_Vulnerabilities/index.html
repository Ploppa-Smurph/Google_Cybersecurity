    <b>03) My Path to Cybersecurity</b>
            Da'Queshia - time management, people skills, and communication are all important
              starts day with emails and then starts working on items in the 'bug queue', which is the list of bugs people have found in an app 
           uses attack trees and vectors everyday
           
    <b>04) Discussion Prompt: Connect with Classmates</b>
          <i>"I started learning cybersecurity to learn a new field and get into a different career. I have years of retail and service industry management experience and feel that I have gone as far as I can in these fields. The location where I live does not have very many job opportunities, so I wanted to study something that is currently in high demand.  I come into this course very curious and eager to learn. I believe everyday, in the security field, I will need to be both curious and eager to learn. The main reason I am taking this course is to get the Cybersecurity Certificate and, to also, reenforce the knowledge I am learning in another cybersecurity course. "</i>

<h2>05.02 Introduction to Assets</h2>
<pre>
    <b>01) Welcome to wk 01</b>
            smartphones, wearables, business automated processes --- enormous amounts of data are created each day
            security is a team effort - diverse teams see things from different points of view

            - Assest, Threat, and Vulnerability
            - Asset Inventories
            - Challenges in a rapidly changing digital world
            - Policies, Standards, and Procedures 
            - NIST Cybersecurity Framework

    <b>02) The What, Why, and How of Asset Security</b>
            Risk - anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset
                    CIA Triad = confidentiality, integrity, availability
            security risk planning is made based on 3 components: assets, threats, vulnerabilities
                - Asset - item perceived as having value to organization; can be physical or digital 
                - Threat - circumstance or event that can negatively affect assets; ex: a thief, bad storm, fire
                - Vulnerability - a weakness that can be exploited; ex: an unlocked door to a restricted area, hole in roof letting rain in 

    <b>03) Understand Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities</b>
            Security Risk = consider potential effects that negative event can have on business
             <b><i>Likelihood x Impact = Risk</i></b>
           used to prevent costly and disruptive events, identify improvments that can be made to systems and process, prioritize critical assets that require attention    


            Threats and Vulnerabilities are the 2 biggest Risk factors

            catagories of Threats: Intentional - ex: hacker gaining access to sensitive information by targeting a misconfigured setting
                                   Unintentional - ex: employee clicks on malicious link in email
                                   
            catagories of Vulnerabilities: Technical - ex: misconfigured software
                                           Human - ex: employee loses keycard in parking lot and allows entrance to facility                         

    <b>04) Life in Asset Security</b>
                starts with using SIEM - 
            problem solving 
               
    <b>05) Security Starts with Asset Classification</b>
            Asset Management - the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them
            Asset Inventory - catalog of assets that need to be protected
            Asset Classification - practice of labling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization

            Asset labeling: Public - shared with anyone
                            Internal Only - shared with anyone in the organization
                            Confidential - only accessed by those that need to work with the data
                            Restricted - need to know; highly sensitive and must be protected

    <b>06) Common Classification Requirements</b>
            Asset Management - tracking assets and the risks that affect them
                    identify, track, and classify assets

            Asset Classification - labeling asset based on sensitivity / importance to an organization
                    what you have
                    where it is
                    who owns it
                    how important it is  
             Public - no negative consequence if released
             Internal-Only - assets available to employees
             Confidential - assets whose disclosure may have negative impact to an organization 
             Restricted - reserved for incredibly sensitive assets, need-to-know information
            
            Challenges in classifying information - 
                
    <b>07) Activity: Classify the Assets Connected to a Home Network</b>
            One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.
        
            An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.
    
            A home office that includes a desktop computer, printer, router, webcam, speakers, headphones, and external hard drive.
    
            You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.
    
    
            To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:
               - Desktop or laptop computers
               - Smartphones
               - Smart home devices
               - Game consoles
               - Storage devices or servers
               - Video streaming devices
    
        Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.

<h2>05.03 Digital and Physical Assets</h2>
<pre>
    <b>01) Assets in a Digital World</b>
            what is valuable about an asset?  the answer is often information / data
            
            <b><i>Data - information that is translated, processed, or stored by a computer</i></b>

            must protect data in 3 states: 
                in use - data being accessed by 1 or more users
                in transit - data being transmitted from 1 point to another
                at rest - data being stored, not currently accessed

        Information Security (InfoSec) - practice of keeping data, in all states, away from unauthorized users

    <b>02) The Challenges of Securing Digital Devices</b>
            <i>'I try to secure devices with multifactor authentication, or biometric locks as much as possible on my phone and tablet. I encrypted my storage devices on my computer to help secure the data on my personal computer. Because I have my computer connected to the internet at all times I keep my devices patched and my firewall enabled. I make certain to check for firmware updates as well as software patches to keep my security up to date. Encrypting data is one way to help keep it secured, but if the encryption key is lost or erased, then the data is unreadable and is therefore lost, also. 
                It seems that most modern applications offer some form of multifactor authentication to help and ensure that the user is who they state they are. By using firewalls and VPNs we can help encapsulate the data we transmit and not allow any unidentified outside traffic into our network. The best way to defend your network is to avoid suspect sites and applications, keep your system up to date with security patches, use a firewall and anti-virus software, and encrypt sensitive data to keep it secure if anything does happen.'</i>

    <b>03) Identify: States of Data in the Workplace</b>     
        
    <b>04) Emergence of Cloud Security</b>
            SaaS (Software as a Service) - front end application accessed via web browser
                ex: Slack, Zoom, Adobe 
            PaaS (Platform as a Service) - back-end application developemnt tools - used to write code, build, manage and deploy apps
                ex: Google App Engine, Heroku, VMWare Cloud Foundry 
            IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) - remote access to range of back-end systems hosted by cloud service provider. 
                ex: Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, AWS

           <b>Shared Responsibility Model</b> - maintaining server and storage security is cloud provider's responsibility, any app you make you have to maintain it's security and make certain the data you upload has integrity and is authentic

         common Cloud security challenges: 
            Misconfiguration - must make certain to configure everything correctly
            Cloud-native Breaches - more likely to occur if there are misconfigured services
            Monitoring Access might be difficult depending on client and level of service
            Meeting Regulatory standards is a concern - must follow law and requirements such as HIPPA, PCI DSS, and GDPR, OSHA,...          
</pre>
<h2>05.04 Risk and Asset Security</h2>
<pre>
    <b>01) Elements of a Security Plan</b>
             security is about people, processes, and technology
           be prepared for Risk - anything that impacts CIA of asset

           Risk Catagories: Damage - 
                            Disclosure - 
                            Loss of Information - 
           
           Security Plan Elements: Policies - Policy -- Set of rules that reduce risk and protect information
                                                policies identify scope, objective, and limitations of security plans
                                              ex: AUP - Acceptable Use Policy, how an employee can access company resources  
                                   Standards - tactical function, reference that inform how to set policies
                                                 standards create a point of reference
                                              ex: NIST Special Publication 800-63B -- improve security by having user password be at least 8 characters long    
                                   Procedures - step-by-step instructions to perform specific security tasks
                                                  normally organizations have procedure documents for multiple 
                                              ex: how to securely reset a password that has been locked
    
    <b>02) NIST Cybersecurity Framework</b>
            NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
           
            Compliance - process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations 
                being out of compliance with regulations can damage an organization's reputation and income (loss of business and fines) 
            Regulations - rules set out by a government / authority to control the practices of an industry
                like policies, but on a much larger scale - uniformed 

            NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) - voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risks

            NIST CSF components:  Core - 5 broad functions: Identify
                                                            Protect
                                                            Detect
                                                            Respond
                                                            Recover
                                  Tiers - range of values 1 - 4
                                             1 is passive and barely making it; 4 is adaptive and the function is performing at exemplary standards. 
                                  Profiles - provide insight into current state of security plan
                                                 like examining photos to see how security plan has changed over time
                1st NIST CSF Core function is Identify - Asset management and risk assessment relate to 1. Identify

    <b>03) Security Guidelines in Action</b>
             Identify -  
             Protect - 
             Detect - 
             Respond - 
             Recover -   
             
             NIST CSF is a voluntary list to follow for enhanced security
             Regulations are NOT voluntary and MUST be followed 

             1. Create a current profile - outline specific needs
             2. Perform risk assessment - identify operations that are meeting business and regulatory standards
             3. Analyze and prioritize - find existing gaps in security operations that place businesses assets at risk 
             4. Implement a plan of action - helps achieve organization's goals and objectives   
    
    <b>04) Activity: Score Risks Based on Their Likelihood and Severity</b>	
            You might recall that the purpose of having a security plan is to be prepared for risks. Assessing potential risks is one of the first steps of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Risk assessments are how security teams determine whether their security operations are adequately positioned to prevent cyber attacks and protect sensitive information.

            You've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

            A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.

            Your supervisor asks you to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, you will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, you will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, you will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. You will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.
